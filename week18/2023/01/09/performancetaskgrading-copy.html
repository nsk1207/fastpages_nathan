<p>Overall, I think I did a better job this week grading these performance tasks than last week. There were only mild discrepancies between my scoring and the collegeboard scoring. However, of those mild discrepancies, I think most come from program purpose and function. I realized how its easy to lose the point for row 1 because students are often unsuccesful in explaining the purpose of their code. They do well on the video portion, but in the written response, fail to describe this purpose. Instead, they focus more on the code and not the purpose. In addition, I noticed that a program may not meet the criteria if it lacks detail. Some of these students lacked important details in the data abstraction section (ex: data stored in lists not being used) or managing complexity (ex: list not being used in their code to manage complexity) rows and therefore, were unsuccessful in meeting those full points. Therefore, for my performance task, I must be very detailed and specific about my program. I will also need to be able to incorporate a variety of functions, abstraction, and details about my complexity.</p>
