Overall, N@TM was a really enjoyable experience to us because we were able to interact with other people. We enjoyed talking to our peers about their projects too. Our favorite projects from other groups was a minesweeper and chess game because they were extremely well made and interactive for the users to play. We also enjoyed talking to our peer’s parents because they asked many questions about our project. We thought our most popular question asked was how we were able to fetch the different recipes in our website. In addition, talking with the CSA kids in the other room was also nice because we got to see how CSA operates their websites (many of them were really good). In conclusion, we had lots of fun at N@tm and we are excited to attend more in the future! Being able to talk about my code with other people was a really different, interesting experience as well. N@TM will surely help me in the future if I happen to get interships, jobs, etc in college.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Unit 4.1 Collegeboard</title><link href="https://nsk1207.github.io/fastpages_nathan/collegeboard/2022/10/16/Unit4.1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Unit 4.1 Collegeboard" /><published>2022-10-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nsk1207.github.io/fastpages_nathan/collegeboard/2022/10/16/Unit4.1</id><author><name></name></author><category term="collegeboard" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Collegeboard Unit 4.1 “The Internet” VIDEO 1 (xxx) Long time ago computers worked in isolation without any help from other users Computers NEED to talk to each other ARPANET was an idea that was around before the internet A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network Each packet also includes the source and the destination information A computer SYSTEM is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a joint purpose A computer NETWORK is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data (this is a type of computing system) Packet Switching is the message that is broken up into packets and sent in any order. the packets are reassembled by the receipient’s device Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver A path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender and a receiver) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Personal API + Basics</title><link href="https://nsk1207.github.io/fastpages_nathan/data/covid" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Personal API + Basics" /><published>2022-10-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://nsk1207.github.io/fastpages_nathan/data/PBL-python_rapidapi</id><author><name></name></author><category term="jupyter" /><category term="week7" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
