My N@TM experience was very fun. I personally found it better this tri than last tri because a lot of the CS projects I viewed increased in professionalism and skill. I saw a variety of arcade websites, car websites, and much more. The ‘vibe’ of this tri’s N@TM felt better as well because I thought there were a lot more kids and parents there from other classes this time. Being able to explain our arcade project to students and parents was fun because not only did we get praise for our hard work, but we also got some contructive criticism on how we can improve the project. For example, I realized I should change my worldle game keyboard layout to qwerty..etc instead of abcdefg. That way, users don’t have to spend a long time trying to find each key. In addition, it was interesting to see other N@TM Projects outside of CSP as well.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CB MC 2</title><link href="https://nsk1207.github.io/fastpages_nathan/2023/01/30/cbmidtermblog.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CB MC 2" /><published>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nsk1207.github.io/fastpages_nathan/2023/01/30/cbmidtermblog</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is my overall score on the MC.
