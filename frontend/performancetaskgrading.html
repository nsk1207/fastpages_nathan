Student 1

Category | Requirements | Student Score | CB Score
-- | -- | -- | --
Program Purpose and Function | input, program functionality, output describes the overall purpose of the program, describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video, describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video. | 1 | 0
Data Abstraction | includes two program code segments, one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type), one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose, identifies the name of the variable representing the list being used in this response, describes what the data contained in this list is representing in the program. | 1 | 1
Managing Complexity | includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program, explains how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, without using this list. | 0 | 0
Procedural Abstraction | includes two program code segments: one showing a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure, one showing where the student-developed procedure is being called, describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | 1 | 1
Algorithm Implementation | includes a program code segment of a student-developed algorithm that includes sequencing selection iteration explains in detailed steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it. | 1 | 1
Testing | describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c, Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute, describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure, identifies the result of each call. | 1 | 1

<ul>
  <li>I gave the student a higher score than the College Board for the Program Purpose and Function category, but it turns out that I was wrong because the student only described the program’s functionality and not the purpose. I gave the student a total score of 5 out of 6, while the College Board gave a score of 4 out of 6.</li>
  <li>In order to avoid the mistake that this student made, my program needs to include a section of code that uses a list to handle complex tasks, such as iterating through the list to check or change something.</li>
  <li>The student did not receive any points for the Program Purpose and Function category because they failed to explain the purpose of the program, even though they completed all the other requirements. This means that they received a score of 0 out of 1</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>My scoring and the College Board’s scoring were both 6 out of 6. I believe that the student did a very thorough job of including all the required information and describing the code segments in the necessary categories.</li>
  <li>In order to earn the Procedural Abstraction point, my program should include a procedure with at least one parameter that plays a significant role in the program. I should also include everything that this student included in their submission, as they received full marks on the scoring.</li>
  <li>It is important to follow the specific criteria for each category and ensure that all the requirements are included in my own performance task. This student did not miss the standard.</li>
