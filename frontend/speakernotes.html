<ul>
  <li>continuous learning is necessary</li>
  <li>“learning how to learn” is a very important step and it varies from company to company</li>
  <li>don’t be concerend with things on the news to be true</li>
  <li>resilience and perseverence is needed to keep on learning your skill</li>
  <li>tech is high demand; be adaptive</li>
  <li>listening to the requirements, and translating those requirments to solve problems</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>interviews are bad
    <ul>
      <li>series of random tests that need to be completed in a certain time frame</li>
      <li>code needs to be worked</li>

<a class="anchor" href="#how-does-coding-help-in-other-industries" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does coding help in other industries</h1>
<ul>
  <li>coding is a way of thinking</li>
  <li>you learn how to dissect something and build something</li>
  <li>problem solve</li>
  <li>critical thinking</li>
  <li>“walk me through your thinking”</li>
  <li>a question thta Kathyleen asks to intview applicants: “How many cars do you think were sold in the cars in the US?”
    <ul>
      <li>looks for assumptions and thought process</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I learned many new things. I learned that coding in the real world can sometimes be a tough process, but perseverence and resillience will lead to success. Preparing yourself and and constantly learning is also a key factor in success. You also have to be a critical thinker when coding and being able to explain your code is extremely important.</p>
