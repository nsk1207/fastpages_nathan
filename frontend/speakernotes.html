<ul>
  <li>coding is a way of thinking</li>
  <li>you learn how to dissect something and build something</li>
  <li>problem solve</li>
  <li>critical thinking</li>
  <li>“walk me through your thinking”</li>
  <li>a question thta Kathyleen asks to intview applicants: “How many cars do you think were sold in the cars in the US?”
    <ul>
      <li>looks for assumptions and thought process</li>

<p>Overall, I learned many new things. I learned that coding in the real world can sometimes be a tough process, but perseverence and resillience will lead to success. Preparing yourself and and constantly learning is also a key factor in success. You also have to be a critical thinker when coding and being able to explain your code is extremely important.</p>
