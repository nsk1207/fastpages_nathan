## Submmission 4 Overall Idea:
The overall idea of this submission was to create a program that simulates a fishing game to prevent from being bored.

    <td><strong>Program Function and Purpose</strong></td>

    <td>The video response effectively demonstrates the input and output of the program which allows the user to move the boat using specific keyboard keys such as a and d, and then increase a total count of fish when the hook comes into contact with one. The objective and function of the program were also clearly stated, with the objective being to alleviate boredom, and the function being to simulate a fishing game.</td>

    <td><strong>Data Abstraction</strong></td>
    <td>1/1</td>
    <td>The written response demonstrates the implementation of a list, referred to as <code>fishtypes</code>, and explains its purpose. The list is in the form of an array and it is used to store the total number of fish caught by the user. The response also shows how the list is used later on to output the total number of fish of different types that were caught by the user.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Managing Complexity</strong></td>
    <td>1/1</td>
    <td>The written response effectively explains how the utilization of a list simplifies the program. The student does not specify what the alternative would have been without the use of a list but it's explained that it would have been more complicated and annoying as it would have required the use of individual variables to store each type of fish caught, which would be tedious, especially if more types of fish were added in the future.</td>
    <td>CB says that they actually got it because the student DOES respond that without the list, they would have to resort to individual variables.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Procedural Abstraction</strong></td>
    <td>1/1</td>
    <td>The written response effectively explains the use of the <code>clonemovement</code> function, which is used to manage the spawning of the fish, including their location, distance, and movement. This function utilizes five different parameters to determine the range and speed of the fish. The student also highlights how this function contributes to the overall functionality of the program by randomly spawning different fish to change the difficulty of the game.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Algorithm Implementation</strong></td>
    <td>1/1</td>
    <td>The algorithm effectively employs a loop to repeatedly move the cloned fish until it reaches the edge of the screen or is caught by the hook. The logic is executed in a specific order, starting with the creation of a fish clone, followed by the execution of the loop and its subsequent conditions. The use of an if statement allows for the selection of whether or not the cloned fish is touching the edge of the screen.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Testing</strong></td>
    <td>1/1</td>
    <td>The written response clearly shows the inputting of two different inputs, one where the clone is touching the right edge of the screen, and another one where its not. The response clearly details the results of each procedure.</td>
    <td>CB says that this student did not earn the point for this row because they only tested for the alternate code segments, rather than actual arguments and inputs into the function itself. It did not earn the point.</td>
