<p>Ashley loved physics a lot and her major is applied physics. Despite her struggles in high school, she still had a love for physics. She is a first generation student and didn’t have much guidance, but still brought herself to success, which is very inspirational.</p>
<ul>
  <li>She doesn’t let her failures define her, which is what inspires her.</li>
  <li>Cal State San Marcos gave her so many opportunities to a greater future.</li>
  <li>She can’t escape coding no matter the STEM field. She uses python to read her data as well, which allowed me to understand how coding is so prominent and versatile today.</li>

<p>Here we are setting up our equipment using the batteries provided. This was my first hands-on experience with electrical engineering (kinda).</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_nathan/pic2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this picture, we created some sort of vibrating tooth brush mechanism using electrical wires and magnets.</p>

<p>Reflection: Overall, I believe that there are many opportunities for different programs and internships at this school and beyond. It was nice to hear college advice from graduate students and get a deeper understanding of the full process. In addition, I liked exploring into the different majors and programs tech schools had to offer, and it gives me inspiration for what I want to do in the future.</p>
