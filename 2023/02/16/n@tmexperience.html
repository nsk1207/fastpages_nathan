<p>My N@TM experience was very fun. I personally found it better this tri than last tri because a lot of the CS projects I viewed increased in professionalism and skill. I saw a variety of arcade websites, car websites, and much more. The ‘vibe’ of this tri’s N@TM felt better as well because I thought there were a lot more kids and parents there from other classes this time. Being able to explain our arcade project to students and parents was fun because not only did we get praise for our hard work, but we also got some contructive criticism on how we can improve the project. In addition, it was interesting to see other N@TM Projects outside of CSP as well.</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_nathan/snake.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I felt that their website was quite analagous to our website. They have a series of different arcade games in which they utilize backend databases. They focus a lot on their leaderboard and being able to display certain information from their games. I played the snake game Max made and in my opinion, it was very well executed. It was smooth, it was functional, and it even allowed users to store their data/record after the game they play. One thing I told them that they could improve on was not limiting the usernames to 3 characters because it could get repetive and not as unique as a professional game. Overall though, I think they did a very good job. They had clear functionality, clear user input and output, and met all the collegeboard criteria. Mr Mortenson also seemed impressed with their website and how everything flowed together. I also tried playing their checkerboard game, which in my opinion was really good. It felt like a real game. However, if I rememeber correctly, they didn’t have any backend work, so I suggested they added a point leaderboard system as well.</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_nathan/pong.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This was another arcade website that I found really good. They each had functional games and I especially liked this pong game because it was a two player game. This made the gaming experience a lot more genuine. Although they were organized with their frontend, however, I suggested that they changed the theme from the default to make thier game look even better. Not that the default theme is bad, but it isn’t the best either (in my opinion). I also suggested that they add some sort of backend to frontend connection in order to fufill collegeboard requriements, but further enhance their games. Overall, the game they presented was a good start to something that can be turned into something great.</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_nathan/toolkit.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In my opinion, this was one of the best projects I saw at N@TM. Everyone had a clear frontend to backend connection and was able to explain the purpose of each of their things. My favorite feature was probably the class rank calculator where we had to input GPA, classes, etc. and it would generate a ranking for each student. It seemed like an enhanced version of Synergy, the gradebook. In addition, they had a schedule feature where students could input their schedules</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_nathan/car.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This was another car website that I saw at N@TM. It helps people find their dream car and it takes people through a series of filters and quizzes. Users are also able to sign in and create a user for themselves and add cars they’re looking at on their wish list. Users are also able to leave reviews on the website once they sign in. The frontend of this website was very professional with their home tab on the tab and the logo they had. They also had clear functioanlity, user input/output, and met most collegeboard criteria.</p>

<p><img src="/fastpages_nathan/heart.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This was an interesting art piece to me. The vivid colors of red and burgundy and the details of the heart really made this piece stick out to me. I also liked the message of the art piece which was to spread and give love to each other.</p>

<h3 id="seventh-project-i-viewed-a-turtle-cup-from-ceramics">
<a class="anchor" href="#seventh-project-i-viewed-a-turtle-cup-from-ceramics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Seventh Project I viewed: A turtle cup from Ceramics</h3>
<p><img src="/fastpages_nathan/turtle.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I really liked this project because it was very unique from the other ceramics I saw. The person made it so that you could not only carry it by the handle, but you could also put stuff in it. I thought that was really creative. I also liked the smooth texture of the project and the way it glistened. The mixture of green and blue was also very nice, in my opinon.</p>
