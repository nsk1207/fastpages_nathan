> Questions asked by students
# Agile Methodology
- different companies use it depending on their needs
- good way to coordinate with other engineers on a team 

# Machine Learning
- used python libraries exposed
- tensorflow 
- ran experiments
- hosted a fork of git lab 
- 100000 terabytes is called a pedabyte

# What is the most important skill to have in the tech industry?
- continuous learning is necessary 
- "learning how to learn" is a very important step and it varies from company to company
- don't be concerend with things on the news to be true
- resilience and perseverence is needed to keep on learning your skill 
- tech is high demand; be adaptive 
- listening to the requirements, and translating those requirments to solve problems 

# What are the biggest challenges in the tech industry and how they overcame the obstacels? 
- interviews are bad
    - series of random tests that need to be completed in a certain time frame
    - code needs to be worked 

# How does coding help in other industries
- coding is a way of thinking
- you learn how to dissect something and build something
- problem solve
- critical thinking
- "walk me through your thinking"
- a question thta Kathyleen asks to intview applicants: "How many cars do you think were sold in the cars in the US?"
    - looks for assumptions and thought process

# Reflection
Overall, I learned many new things. I learned that coding in the real world can sometimes be a tough process, but perseverence and resillience will lead to success. Preparing yourself and and constantly learning is also a key factor in success. You also have to be a critical thinker when coding and being able to explain your code is extremely important.
