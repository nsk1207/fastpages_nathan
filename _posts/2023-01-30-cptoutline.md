## Overview
Our project is an arcade simultation with popular recreations of games in the past. Users can register and compete with other players to get on top of leaderboards. We will have 5 different games, all of which takes knowledge/inspiration from APCSP. 

### My Role
I am the scrum master of our team. My game is a Wordle inspired game in which users can challenge themselves to a word guessing game. 

### My Game
![]({{site.baseurl}}/wordgame.png)

Here is a prototype of my game. Essentially, the user will have an option to either guess the word or play again by reloading. In my game, I will make it so that everytime the user wants a hint, it will return it in gray, green or yellow, just like wordle. They have 6 tries. I want to format it similarly to wordle with the boxes and the keyboard at the bottom. 

### CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Concepts

Create: Create new words by pulling from the database of words (API)

Read: Program reads user input of words and check to see if user guess is the correct guess or not 

Update: Update with new words every time a user guesses the correct word or gets a hint

Delete: Delete existing word when a user presses the “new word button”


### Collegeboard Criteria

### Video Plans
I plan on showing: 

- A screen that gives the user an option to press the “play” button
- Once the user has pressed play, a new screen will show with the program telling the user to start guessing
- Also want to show the guess count going up
- Specific messages like "wrong" or "correct"
- Show me winning and losing
- Show me generating two differnt types of words
- Make sure to show input, output, functionality, etc. 


### Reflection
So far, I have the general outline of everything, but I still need to work and finetune everything. I'm most worried about the algorithim portion of the CPT, which is why I am going to do my best to make sure that it is good and functional. If that happens, I feel like I could be successful on the CPT portion of the exam.
