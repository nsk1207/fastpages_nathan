# Plan for quiz on applab (multiplication quiz)
In my quiz, I want to try to have an infinite amount of questions by using the random number block of code. In addition, I plan on adding sound effects when getting a question right and wrong. I want to add three pages on app lab: Start screen, quiz screen, and a result screen. In my result screen, I want to add a final score thing (something out of something, for example). I would start by defining all my variables at the top, then creating my functions of code.
