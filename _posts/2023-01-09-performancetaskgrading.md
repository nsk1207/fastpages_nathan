|Reporting Category|Student Grading Score|Collegeboard's Score|Comments|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Program Purpose and Function|1|0|The video was demonstrated clearly and the explanation followed the criteria, but Collegeboard did not award a point.|
|Data Abstraction|1|1|The data stored in the list was shown and the second code segment demonstrated its use. The name of the list variable was provided and the data it represented was described.|
|Managing Complexity|0|0|No program code was shown in this category.|
|Procedural Abstraction|1|1|The procedure and its application was shown and its contribution to the program's functionality was fully described.|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1|The code segment demonstrated sequencing, selection, and iteration using a for loop. It was very detailed and could likely be recreated.|
|Testing|1|1|The written response clearly answered all of the criteria.|

### Student 1 Notes
- I gave the student a higher score than the College Board for the Program Purpose and Function category, but it turns out that I was wrong because the student only described the program's functionality and not the purpose. I gave the student a total score of 5 out of 6, while the College Board gave a score of 4 out of 6.
- In order to avoid the mistake that this student made, my program needs to include a section of code that uses a list to handle complex tasks, such as iterating through the list to check or change something.
- The student did not receive any points for the Program Purpose and Function category because they failed to explain the purpose of the program, even though they completed all the other requirements. This means that they received a score of 0 out of 1

|Reporting Category|Student Grading Score|Collegeboard's Score|Comments|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Program Purpose and Function|1|1|The video demonstrated input, program functionality, and output. The written response clearly described the overall purpose, the program's functionality as shown in the video, and the input and output shown in the video.|
|Data Abstraction|0|1|The first code segment did not show a list, only a function.|
|Managing Complexity|1|1|The written response explained how the list manages complexity and the code segment demonstrated this.|
|Procedural Abstraction|1|1|Both code segments showed the procedure and its call. The description of the procedure was also very detailed and showed how it contributed to the overall functionality.|
|Algorithm Implementation|1|1|Sequencing, selection, and iteration were all present in the program code segment. The steps of the algorithm were explained in great detail.|
|Testing|1|1|Two calls to the procedure were described in detail in 3c, including the conditions and results of each call.|

### Student 2 Notes
- My scoring and the College Board's scoring were both 6 out of 6. I believe that the student did a very thorough job of including all the required information and describing the code segments in the necessary categories.
- In order to earn the Procedural Abstraction point, my program should include a procedure with at least one parameter that plays a significant role in the program. I should also include everything that this student included in their submission, as they received full marks on the scoring.
- It is important to follow the specific criteria for each category and ensure that all the requirements are included in my own performance task. This student did not miss the standard.
