# Stem at CSUSM 

### Speaker Notes

Ashley loved physics a lot and her major is applied physics. Despite her struggles in high school, she still had a love for physics. She is a first generation student and didn't have much guidance, but still brought herself to success, which is very inspirational.
- She doesn't let her failures define her, which is what inspires her.
- Cal State San Marcos gave her so many opportunities to a greater future.
- She can't escape coding no matter the STEM field. She uses python to read her data as well, which allowed me to understand how coding is so prominent and versatile today.  

### Pathways/Majors/Clubs/Opportunities that CSUSM offers 
- applied physics
    - masters program for mechanical engineering
    - hands on coursework is provided
- biological sciences
- computer sciences (lots of options)
    - computer information systems
    - cyber security
    - computer engineering 
- math 
    - algorithms, applied, etc. 
- chemistry
- fun hack-a-thons 
- robotics
- women in stem

### Internships 
- networking internships 
- many local companies come to the college to get to know students, so take advantage of that
- try to avoid unpaid internships 
- asking faculty and going to writing centers can help students gain a internship opportunity 

### Programs
- Summer Scholar Program
    - Research program that lasted 10 weeks with pay 
- Quantum Bridge Program
    - 4 week where students learn about quantum information 

### Funds For College Facts/Tips
- scholarships are private owned while grants are publicly funded 
- how much parents make plays into receiving a grant or not 
- loans come in 2 parts a subsidized loan vs unsubsidized
- financial aid office can help you see what you can qualify for 

### Life after CSUSM
- graduate school 
- many end up working for private industries rather than public industries (ex, schools)
- if you stay for a PHD, you should get paid to research for their school because it can take up to 10 years of hard work and dedication 

# Stem Activity After Talk

Here we are setting up our equipment using the batteries provided. This was my first hands-on experience with electrical engineering (kinda).

In this picture, we created some sort of vibrating tooth brush mechanism using electrical wires and magnets. 

Reflection: Overall, I believe that there are many opportunities for different programs and internships at this school and beyond. It was nice to hear college advice from graduate students and get a deeper understanding of the full process. In addition, I liked exploring into the different majors and programs tech schools had to offer, and it gives me inspiration for what I want to do in the future.
