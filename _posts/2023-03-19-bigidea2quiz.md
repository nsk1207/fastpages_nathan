## Here is my overall score on the MC. I got a 23/25, which is a 92%

## Question 2: Advantage of lossless over lossy compression (Skill 1.D)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/q2.png)  
I got this question wrong because I didn't realize that the ability to keep data secure is not a primary function of a compression algorithm. B is correct (A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot.) because lossless compression algorithms are guaranteed to be able to reconstruct the original data, while lossy compression algorithms are not. It's important for me to really understand this because it was one of the lessons we specifically gone over during class. 

## Question 21: Museum photograph spreadsheet (Skill 2.B)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/q21.png)  
I got this question wrong because I only picked 1 out of the 2 correct answers. Choice B (Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by year) was correct because filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Sorting by year will sort the remaining entries in column C from least to greatest, putting the photograph with the lowest year value in the first row of the spreadsheet. And then I put answer choice C (Sort by subject, then sort by year, then filter by photographer), when the answer was D. C is incorrect because this sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1. Choice D (Sort by year, then filter by year, then filter by photographer) is correct because sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet.

## Question 25: Effect of appending three zeros to a binary number (Skill 2.B)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/q25.png) 
I got this question right but I wanted to put it here because I was a little confused when reading it. The answer is C (The transformed number is 8 times the value of the original number.) While doing the quiz I learned that it's correct because appending a 0 to the end of a binary number multiplies the number by 2. Therefore, appending three 0s to the end of a binary number multiples the number by 2 three times, which is the same as multiplying the number by 8.

## Conclusion: 
Overall, I think I performed pretty decent on this quiz. I still have room for improvement however, as the ap exam requires a high percentage of correct answers in order to get the 5. I will continue to learn/develop my skills for the questions I got wrong.
