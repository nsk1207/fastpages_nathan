## Unit 2 Binary/Data Terms
---------------
- Bits - the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and solve
- Bytes - unit of data that is 8 binary digits long
- Hexadecimal - Numbering system with base 16
- Nibbles - 4 consecutive binary digits or half of an 8 bit byte
Binary Numbers: 
- Unsigned Integer - integers but have the property that they have a sign attached to them 
- Signed Integer - 32 bit datum that encodes an integer in a specific range
- Floating Point - is a positive or negative whole number with a decimal point 
Binary Data Abstractions:
- Boolean - a boolean is a true false statement
- ASCII - stands for American Standard Code for Information interchange, a standard data-encoding format for electronic communication between computers
- Unicode - an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts, by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs
- RGB - RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display. Red, green, and blue can be combined in various proportions to obtain any color in the visible spectrum. Levels of R, G, and B can each range from 0 to 100 percent of full intensity
Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (note discussed yet)

## Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms
-------------------
- Variables - a value that can change, depending on the conditions or on information passed to the program 
- Data Types - a particular kind of data item, as defined by the values it can take, the programming language used, or the operations that can be performed on it
- Assignment Operators - used to assign the value, variable and function to another variable
Managing Complexity with Variables:  
- Lists:  a sequence of several variables, grouped together under a single name
- 2D Lists: A two-dimensional list can also be used to store objects, which is especially convenient for programming sketches that involve some sort of "grid" or "board"
- Dictionaries: A dictionary has a set of keys and each key has a single associated value
- class: a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior
- Algorithms: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure that defines a set of instructions that must be carried out in a specific order to produce the desired result
- Sequence: the order that commands are executed by a computer, allows us to carry out tasks that have multiple steps
- Selection: Selection is a programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met
- Iteration: a sequence of instructions or code being repeated until a specific end result is achieved
- Expressions: a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value
- Comparison Operators: compare two expressions and return a Boolean value that represents the relationship of their values
- Truth Tables: A truth table is a way of summarising and checking the logic of a circuit. The table shows all possible combinations of inputs and, for each combination, the output that the circuit will produce. You can produce truth tables for parts of a circuit to check the logic at any stage.
- Characters: a display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbol
- Strings:  a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable
- Length: a code which maps source symbols to a variable number of bits
- Concatenation: means obtaining a new string that contains both of the original strings
Upper
Lower
- Traversing Strings: Traversing a string means accessing all the elements of the string one after the other by using the subscript. A string can be traversed using for loop or while loop.
- Python If: It decides whether certain statements need to be executed or not. It checks for a given condition, if the condition is true, then the set of code present inside the ” if ” block will be executed otherwise not
- Elif: used in conditional statements (if statements), and is short for else if
- Else conditionals: Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Nested Selection Statements:  used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task
- Python For - for loop
- While loops with Range: “for loops” are to iterate throught a group of items (range is a number iterator). So you can know beforehand how many time the code will be executed
- Combining loops with conditionals to Break: Within the for loop, there is an if statement that presents the condition that if the variable number is equivalent to the integer 5, then the loop will break. Within the loop is also a print() statement that will execute with each iteration of the for loop until the loop breaks, since it is after the break statement
- Continue Procedural Abstraction - breaking up code into multiplie pieces with procedures 
- Python Def procedures - the function that calls a procedure
- Parameters - input values of a procedure
- Return Values - what the procedure gives as a result
