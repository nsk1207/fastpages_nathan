## Binary Math Hacks

**Question**: How do you think we should find the difference of two binary numbers? The product? The quotient? What rules need to be followed for those operations? Look into all of this on the Internet and note down important information you find (0.45) 

To subtract binary numbers, the process is quite similar to subtracting base 10 numbers. When 0 is subtracted from 1, it is necessary to borrow 1 from the next higher bit, reducing that bit by 1 and leaving a remainder of 1. When multiplying binary numbers, the product is either the binary number itself or 0. To calculate, shift the non-zero multiplier to the left and add the shifted numbers together. To divide two binary numbers, certain rules apply (outlined below), and division by 0 is impossible. When the divisor is greater than the dividend, set the quotient to 0 and bring down the second bit of the dividend. But if the dividend is larger, multiply the divisor by 1 and subtract the result. Then, find the remainder, repeat the first step, and continue until the remainder is 0.


Based on what you find online, fill out the tables below for subtracting, multiplying, and dividing binary numbers (0.45):

Subtracting Binary Numbers Rules

|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **1-1** | **1-0** | **0-1** | **0-0** |
|    0     |     1    |     1    |     0    |


Multiplying Binary Numbers Rules

|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **1x1** | **1x0** | **0x1** | **0x0** |
|    1     |     0    |    0     |    0     |


Dividing Binary Numbers Rules

# Logic Gates

1. How can logic gates be used to execute basic computer functions? **Digital circuits can be constructed with the help of logic gates. Additionally, these gates play a vital role in fundamental computer operations as they are required to process binary data through the use of Boolean logic operations. This facilitates intricate decision-making processes.**

2. What is the difference between boolean operations and logic gates? **The logic gates and Boolean operations are distinct entities, as the latter are executed by the former. The logic operations serve as the housing for the various gates, which utilize Boolean data to carry out operations such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR.**
