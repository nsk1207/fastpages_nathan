# Vocab quiz
For my quiz, there are 7 different questions. Each is worth 1 point and at the end, the quiz will tell the score. I added the 3 questions Mr. Mortenson had + 4 new questions. I will now explain some of the things I added to my quiz code. At the start, I added a numbering system because I thought it would look organized. In addition, I was able to calculate the fraction score into a percentage that is rounded to the nearest integer number.
