# Performance Task Idea 1:

## Calculator that solves systems of equations 

### Program Purpose and Function
For my trimester project, I want to try and create a graphing calculator that will help people graph and solve system of equations. 
When the user inputs numbers into the equations, the computer will output results with the intersecting coordinates and graph. 

### Data Abstraction
The coding in this project will consist of mostly data and storing it through code. I want about 5-10 differnent graph types on my app. I have to limit the input that a person can give, so it is easier for the code to create two intersecting graphs. 

### Managing Complexity
The main objective of the app is to compare the user input in a system of equations and real calculators that show you the intersection points of functions. There will be multiple types of graphs the user can ask the app to draw, and will create complexity as it compares multiple graphs together. 

### Procedural Abstraction
The procedure is having data stored with the person's input. Then the results of the program would match their equations with a graph. I might call this part graph abstraction, and I will include multiple parameters such as whether if they want a quadratic and linear, a linear and linear, etc. 

### Algorithm Implementation
The algorithm will be based on their choice of equations. Different graphs will be chosen based on the users input, and the graphs would be iteration. However, I would need to learn algorithims. 

### Testing
The testing will be done with a brief explanation and video.

## Review of "How I got a 5, by Bria":

Here are a few notes I jotted down while reading about Bria's tips that will help me succeed on the AP Exam (5):
- watch Khan Academy videos 
- practice the practice tests like the real thing because the real thing is going to be similar
- cite all sources that are not yours
- review previous college board scoring examples
- review scoring guidelines
