# Performance Task Idea 1:

## Application that hosts multiple different games 

### Program Purpose and Function
For our  trimester project, we want to try and create a application that can host different games that users can play. 
When the user inputs their choices into the app, the computer will output results with the corresponding game they want to play

### Data Abstraction
The coding in this project will consist of mostly data and storing it through code. We want about 3-4 differnent games on the app. 

### Managing Complexity
The main objective of the app is to compare the user input with things like up arrow down arrow and outputs that allow the game to actually show what the user is doing. There will be multiple types of games the user can ask the app to play, and will create complexity as it compares multiple games together. 

### Procedural Abstraction
The procedure is having data stored with the person's input. Then the results of the program would match their inputs with a game. We might call this part game abstraction, and we will include multiple parameters such as if they want tetris, snake, etc. 

### Algorithm Implementation
The algorithm will be based on their choice of game. Different games will be chosen based on the users input, and the games would be iteration. However, we would need to learn algorithims. 

### Testing
The testing will be done with a brief explanation and video.
