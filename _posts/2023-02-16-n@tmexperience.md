# My N@TM Experience!
My N@TM experience was very fun. I personally found it better this tri than last tri because a lot of the CS projects I viewed increased in professionalism and skill. I saw a variety of arcade websites, car websites, and much more. Being able to see my peer's joy when presenting their projects was also enjoyable to see. In addition, the parents and Mr Mort and Mr Yeung enjoying everything made the experience very pleasant. In addition, it was interesting to see other N@TM Projects outside of CSP as well. 

### First Project I viewed: An arcade website created by Max, Jishnu, Alan, and Evan (Period 3 of Mr. Mortenson)

I felt that their website was quite analagous to our website. They have a series of different arcade games in which they utilize backend databases. They focus a lot on their leaderboard and being able to display certain information from their games. I played the snake game Max made and in my opinion, it was very well executed. It was smooth, it was functional, and it even allowed users to store their data/record after the game they play. One thing I told them that they could improve on was not limiting the usernames to 3 characters because it could get repetive and not as unique as a professional game. Overall though, I think they did a very good job. They had clear functionality, clear user input and output, and met all the collegeboard criteria. Mr Mortenson also seemed impressed with their website and how everything flowed together. I also tried playing their checkerboard game, which in my opinion was really good. It felt like a real game. However, if I rememeber correctly, they didn't have any backend work, so I suggested they added a point leaderboard system as well. 

### Second Project I viewed: A electric car website created by Adi's group (Period 5 of Mr. Yeung)

### Third Project I viewed: Another Arcade website from a group from Period 3 of Mr. Mortenson

This was another arcade website that I found really good. They each had functional games and I especially liked this pong game because it was a two player game. This made the gaming experience a lot more genuine. Although they were organized with their frontend, however, I suggested that they changed the theme from the default to make thier game look even better. Not that the default theme is bad, but it isn't the best either (in my opinion). I also suggested that they add some sort of backend to frontend connection in order to fufill collegeboard requriements, but further enhance their games. Overall, the game they presented was a good start to something that can be turned into something great. 

### Fourth Project I viewed: A GPA/Academic Stats website from Alex Lu's group (Period 5 Mr. Yeung)

In my opinion, this was one of the best projects I saw at N@TM. Everyone had a clear frontend to backend connection and was able to explain the purpose of each of their things. My favorite feature was probably the class rank calculator where we had to input GPA, classes, etc. and it would generate a ranking for each student. It seemed like an enhanced version of Synergy, the gradebook.
