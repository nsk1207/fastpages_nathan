## Collegeboard Unit 1.2 Notes + Quiz
- Categories of innnovations: Applications (games, social media, etc.), Physical Devices (phones, computers, etc.), and Systems (E-commerce, E-mail, cloud services)
- Computer Programs accept input in many ways (touch, audio, visual, text)
- Many programs are written in an event driven environement
- "Events" are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program
- Input usually affects the output
- What is a program? A program is a collection of statements. A statement is a single command. A group of statements is called a code segment. Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language.

## Collegeboard Unit 1.3 Notes + what to improve on 
- How programs are developed: Starts with an idea, then programs are developed with a specific purpose, then developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan
- Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect
- Developers must
1. determine the requirments of the program
2. understand the contraints
3. understand the user concerns and interests 
- How do developers investigate?
1. surverys
2. user testing
3. interviews
4. direct observations
- Developers design the program by:
1. brainstorming (draw on investigation)
2. planning user experience
3. laying out the user interface
4. organizing into modules
- prgram development is almost never a solo endeavor (work with your team)
- When does documentation happen?
1. at the beginning: list specifications
2. during: to keep track of process
3. after: to explain the overall process
- documentation throughout can improve efficiency of overall programming process + programmers' ability to test and refine the program 
- maybe read more carefully as a whole 
- focus on key words and phrases test
