            "title": "Searching Introduction",
            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

The code above is the same as below: . umbrella = !sunny &amp;&amp; rainy; console.log(umbrella); . false .

Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 .

We enjoyed talking to our peers about their projects too. Our favorite projects from other groups was a minesweeper and chess game because they were extremely well made and interactive for the users to play. We also enjoyed talking to our peer’s parents because they asked many questions about our project. We thought our most popular question asked was how we were able to fetch the different recipes in our website. In addition, talking with the CSA kids in the other room was also nice because we got to see how CSA operates their websites (many of them were really good). In conclusion, we had lots of fun at N@tm and we are excited to attend more in the future! Being able to talk about my code with other people was a really different, interesting experience as well. N@TM will surely help me in the future if I happen to get interships, jobs, etc in college. . Collegeboard Trimester 1 Final Questions and Review . Question 1 (Topic 1.2, Skill 4.A): Behavior of code that multiples inside a loop. For question 1, reading the code segment carefully was a important aspect in answering the question. The code initializes the result to 2 then repeatedely multiplies result by 5 inside a loop. The loop then iterates three times (Answer: D) | . | Question 2 (Topic 1.2, Skill 4.A): Behavior of mystery procedure with if statement Again, being able to differentiate all the different answers was important in determining the answer, as all of them were similar (Answer: C) | . | Question 3 (Topic 1.1, Skill 1.c): Benefits of assembling a diverse team Easy question, common sense | . | Question 4 (Topic 1.2, Skill 3.A): Data needed for DineOutHelper Another relatively easy one | . | Question 5 (Topic 1.2, Skill 3.A): Data not provided by Alejandra but needed Again, easy enough to read and understand | . | Question 6 (Topic 1.3, Skill 4.A): Documentation for procedure with a loop For this question, analyzing the code to see that it initializes the count to 1 then inside the loop, the value count is displayed and increased by 2 to the next odd integer. The loop terminates when the count reaches the max so all positive odd integers are less than or equal to max when printed | . | Question 7 (Topic 1.3, Skill 4.A): Documentation for procedue with add and div Easy enough, straightforward | . | Question 8 (Topic 1.3, Skill 4.A): Documentation for procedure with lists This one was kind of difficult to understand at first. I had to consult with other csp students before being able to determine the right answer. First, the code creates a copy of numList called newList. Then the element at newList(j) is assigned the element at numList (j). THEREFORE (this is where I was confused), the difference between numList and newList is that the elements at indices j and k are interchanged. The procedure only works if j and k are valid list indices. | I looked over my collegeboard 1.3 notes + the daily video to make sure I had a full grasp on the concept. | . | Question 9 (Topic 1.4, Skill 4.C): Error in reducing score if else Just reading carefully with this one makes the question pretty straightforwards | . | Question 10 (Topic 1.1, Skill 1.c): Faciliate collaboration between group members Easy, common sense | . | Question 11 (Topic 1.2, Skill 4.A): How nested loops with lists functions This one took me some time, but I eventually understood it. The algorithim traverses myList using two nested loops. The outside loop iterates the first elements in the list to the second to last element in the list. For the iteration of the outer loop, the inner one compares that element to every element in the array following (Answer B) | . | Question 12 (Topic 1.2, Skill 3.A) Easy, straightforward | . | Question 13 (Topic 1.3, Skill 4.C) Pretty easy if carefully read | . | Question 14 (Topic 1.4, Skill 4.C): Test cases for grade assignment with nested if Again, pretty easy. At the end, the check minus is displayed instead of the intended check plus | . | Question 15 (Topic 1.1, Skill 1.C) Easy, common sense | . | Question 16, 17, 18 (Topic 4.1, Skill 5.A) All related to the internet lesson from couple weeks ago. I had to review my notes on my website and the collegeboard daily videos to remind myself again | . | Question 19 (Topic 2.1, Skill 1.D): Adding numbers in 4-bit representation I had to watch the daily videos to understand this concept. I learned that the largest binary value that can be represented using 4 bits is 1111, which is equal to the decimal value of 15. Since the sum is larger, an overflow error would occur. | . | Question 20 (Topic 2.1, Skill 1.D): Bits needed to represent directions Important thing to know is that four bits can store 16 pieces of information | . | Question 21 (Topic 2.1, Skill 3.C): Data that can be represented with binary sequences From the videos, it claims that characters, colors, and sound can all be become sequences of bits to represent something. | . | Question 22 (Topic 2.1, Skill 2.B)L Decimal value not equal to given binary values I learned that binary 0011 is 2^1+2^0 = decimal 3. Binary 0110 is 2^2 +2^1 = decimal 6. Finally, 1111 is 2^3+2^2+2^1+2^0 = decimal 15. 9 is the only number not present in this list. | . | Question 23 (Topic 2.1, Skill 3.C): Digital representation of position of runner I was able to make the connection of Analog data, like the runners position, have values that change smoothly rather than abrupt intervals. | . | Question 24 (Topic 2.1 Skill 2.B): Put binary and decimal numbers in order Same skill as Question 22, being able to convert binary to decimal and vice versa | . | Question 25 (Topic 3.1, Skill 3.A): Appropriate data type for age Age is represented as a number, and therefore, is best representative of age. Very straightforward. | . | Question 28 (Topic 3.6, Skill 2.B): Assign cost for utility company I was kind of confused with this question but after reading the question very carefully, I was able to come to my final answer. | . | Question 31 (Topic 3.2 Skill 3.A): Character in a list of strings For this one, I had to look over 3.2 daily videos to make sure I fully grasped the concept. The element at index 3 inwordList is “ghi”. The character at index 2 of “ghi” is “h.” | . | Question 34 (Topic 3.2 Skill 3.B): Music instrument lists after assignments I had to make sure I was following along correctly in this code segment. First, the code segment initializes firstList to contain [“guitar”, “drums”, “bass”], secondList to contain [“flute”, “violin”], and thirdList to contain an empty list. The code segment then swaps the contents of firstList and secondList by assigning firstList to thirdList, then secondList to firstList, then thirdList to secondList. | . | Question 35 (Topic 3.6 Skill 2.B): Set maxPS based on time I had lots of trouble with this one at first. Getting to D was easy because it was simply an if else statement, but I was debating for a long time between A and B. In the end, I declared the answer as A because in B, the maxPS &lt;–50 would override the entire code, making it invalid. | . | Question 37 (Topic 3.3 Skill 2.B) The first statement assigns the value of num1 to the temporary variable temp. The second statement assigns the value of num2 to num1. The third statement assigns the original value of num1, which is stored in temp, to num2. The original values of num1 to num2 are interchanged. Therefore the answer is D. I think reading this one carefully was also a key factor. | . | Question 40 (Topic 3.6 Skill 4.B) Since 3 &lt; 5, the program will execute the ELSE code block and will print x - y = 3 - 5 = -2 | . | Question 45 (Topic 3.10 Skill 4.B): Values of first and second after assignments This one was kind of confusing as well. The code segment iterates through each element in the list, incrementing count1 for each positive value and incrementing count2 otherwise. The list contains two positive values, so count1 is 2 and count2 is 3. | . | Question 48 (Topic 3.1, Skill 4.B): Which variables are equal to 50 after assignments I got this one wrong. I didn’t realize that the first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of y (which is 50) to x. The fifth statement assigns the value of z (which is 75) to y. The sixth statement assigns the value of x (which is 50) to z. Therefore, x and z both have the value 50. | . | Question 50 (Topic 3.4 Skill 4.B) initials ← concat(prefix(firstName, 1), prefix(lastName, 1)) will correctly form the initials. It uses calls to prefix to obtain the first letters of each name, then uses a call to concat to concatenate the two letters in the correct order. | . | . Overall, I think that I need to most work on Unit 3 and specifcally skill 4.B . Final Score: 49/50 .",

Drafting a Plan for the Final Project (Group Ideas) . One idea for the project would be a platform that consists of multiple apps (games)(maybe 3 to 4, something similiar to game pigeon). The games would take user input and it would also need algorithms to shoot basketballs, arrows, etc. This app would teach our team many different skills in programming. In addition, it will take our interest for 8 weeks due to the vast tasks that need to be completed. . Our Team Roles: . Frontend Developer: create the visual images of games on the screen | Backend Developer: create algortihims behind the scenes | Dev Ops: make sure website functions correctly | Scrum Master: faciliate the team and assign each member differnet goals, while also helping the frontend and backend developers | .

For our trimester project, we want to try and create a application that can host different games that users can play. When the user inputs their choices into the app, the computer will output results with the corresponding game they want to play . Data Abstraction . The coding in this project will consist of mostly data and storing it through code. We want about 3-4 differnent games on the app. . Managing Complexity . The main objective of the app is to compare the user input with things like up arrow down arrow and outputs that allow the game to actually show what the user is doing. There will be multiple types of games the user can ask the app to play, and will create complexity as it compares multiple games together. . Procedural Abstraction . The procedure is having data stored with the person’s input. Then the results of the program would match their inputs with a game. We might call this part game abstraction, and we will include multiple parameters such as if they want tetris, snake, etc. . Algorithm Implementation . The algorithm will be based on their choice of game. Different games will be chosen based on the users input, and the games would be iteration. However, we would need to learn algorithims. . Testing . The testing will be done with a brief explanation and video. .",

Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many Dictionary is used to define data patterns. Iteration is often used to process through lists. To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . I created 4 dictionaries within my list. .
