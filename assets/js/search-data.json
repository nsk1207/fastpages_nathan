Questions that I found confusing a little bit: Question 27: RGB values in digital images . . I got this question right but I had to research a little bit before arriving to the answer. I learned that if a negative of the original image is made, each RGB triplet value will be computed by subtracting the original value from 255. The original value can then be restored by subtracting the new value from 255. This process is lossless because the exact original can be restored. This is why C is correct. . Reflection .

In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is constant. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # It doesn&#39;t output the repeated numbers (Only outputs one of each) # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Both will always contain unique values (It disregards the duplicate items) . {1, 2, 3} . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary. As always, documentation is always the main source for all the full capablilties. . lover_album = { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Taylor Swift&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2019, &quot;genre&quot;: [&quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Synth-pop&quot;], &quot;tracks&quot;: { 1: &quot;I Forgot That You Existed&quot;, 2: &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, 3: &quot;Lover&quot;, 4: &quot;The Man&quot;, 5: &quot;The Archer&quot;, 6: &quot;I Think He Knows&quot;, 7: &quot;Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince&quot;, 8: &quot;Paper Rings&quot;, 9: &quot;Cornelia Street&quot;, 10: &quot;Death By A Thousand Cuts&quot;, 11: &quot;London Boy&quot;, 12: &quot;Soon You&#39;ll Get Better (feat.

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . They need to care because they want their program to run efficiently and in the quickest time possible.

Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . Both because as the images increase in size, not only does space become an issue, but so does time. In addition, vscode couldn&#39;t even render the image in the end, ultimately proving that this function is bad for normal computers. | . Big O Notation .

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) . Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . 832040 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1], [2, 3], [2], [3], []] . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | . The difference in timing between the functions seems to be based upon the mathematical multipliers associated. For example, in the exponential case below, the time will likely be close to double the previous because the product is continuously multipled by 2 for each n. . For logarithmic, the difference in timing would likely be less extreme as time goes on, since logarithm functions grow longer more than they do greater. It makes sense that quadratic gets greater and greater as n increases, for example. . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? | . Time and space complexity are important when choosing an algorithm because they determine how much time and memory an algorithm will require to solve a problem. An algorithm that is efficient in terms of time and space complexity will be faster and require less memory than an algorithm that is not efficient, making it a better choice for solving larger problems or problems that need to be solved quickly. . If the algorithm doesn&#39;t work, this is bad from both the perspective of a programmer and of a consumer. A consumer does not want to work with a laggy, slow program that fails to account for large amounts of data and programmers will find it difficult to work around processing algorithms that are very time-consuming. . Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? | . No, you should not always use a constant time algorithm or never use an exponential time algorithm. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem being solved and the trade-offs between time and space complexity. In some cases, a constant time algorithm may not be able to solve the problem efficiently, while in other cases, an exponential time algorithm may be the only practical solution. It is important to consider the constraints and requirements of the problem at hand when choosing an algorithm. . What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? | . Some general patterns to determine time and space complexity are analyzing loops, recursive functions, and nested data structures. For time complexity, counting the number of operations executed by an algorithm related to/caused by the input size is often used to determine time complexity. For space complexity, analyzing the amount of memory required to store data as a function of the input size is often used to determine space complexity. . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice . Question 1 - What is the time and space complexity of the following code? . a = 0 b = 0 for i in range(N): a = a + random() for i in range(M): b = b + random() . O(N * M) time, O(1) space | O(N + M) time, O(N + M) space | O(N + M) time, O(1) space | O(N * M) time, O(N + M) space | My answer: 3 (Correct) . Reasoning: The two for loops are linear O(N) and O(M) respectively, but because they aren&#39;t nested, the time complexity isn&#39;t described by multiplying N and M. Instead, it would be O(N + M). The variables&#39; sizes are singular and not affected by the size of the input, so the space complexity can be represented as O(1) (linear). . Question 2 - What is the time complexity of the following code? . a = 0 for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i,N)): a = a + i + j . O(N) | O(N*log(N)) | O(N * Sqrt(N)) | O(N*N) My answer: 4 (Correct) | Reasoning: These are nested for loops, which were the exact example of quadratic time complexity we learned in class, so I was pretty easily able to identify it as quadratic (O(N*N)). . Question 3 - What is the time complexity of the following code? . O(n) | O(nlog(n)) | O(n^2) | O(n^2(log(n))) My answer: 2 (Correct) | Reasoning: I knew the first loop was linear, but the second one seemed like it was doing something like moving up in powers of two, like log with a base of 2. So, the time complexity was O(n * log(2)(n)) or O(nlog(n)). . Question 4: What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y? . X will always be a better choice for small inputs | X will always be a better choice for large inputs | Y will always be a better choice for small inputs | X will always be a better choice for all inputs | My answer: 2 (Correct) . Reasoning: I had to look up &quot;asymptoticallly&quot; to figure it out. Now I know that it means that X is more efficient than Y when a number n is greater than a certain limiting (positive) constant. . Question 5 - What is the time complexity of the following code? . O(N) | O(Sqrt(N)) | O(N / 2) | O(log N) My answer: 4 (Correct) | Reasoning: This was a weird one again because it seemed to resemble the log base 2 example from before, but hasn&#39;t been phrased as a while loop yet. Ultimately, I made an educated answer, but not a completely confident one. . Question 6 - Which of the following best describes the useful criterion for comparing the efficiency of algorithms? . Time | Memory | Both of the above | None of the above My answer: 3 (Correct) | Reasoning: This is just a basic concept that we learned from the lesson. . Question 7 - How is time complexity measured? . By counting the number of algorithms in an algorithm. | By counting the number of primitive operations performed by the algorithm on a given input size. | By counting the size of data input to the algorithm. | None of the above My answer: 2 (Correct) | Reasoning: This just sounded like a textbook definition, though I didn&#39;t know what it meant by &quot;primitive.&quot; I knew it wasn&#39;t counting the size of the data, and I knew it wasn&#39;t as simple as just counting the number of algorithms. . Question 8 - What will be the time complexity of the following code? . for i in range(n): i=i*k . O(n) | O(k) | O(logk(n)) | O(logn(k)) My answer: 3 (Correct) | Reasoning: Mathematically, it only makes sense to be 3. It couldn&#39;t be linear like 1 or 2, since the variable i, which dictates the continued run of the program, is being multiplied by k. In this case, another way to explain the program is that it loops until k has multiplied by itself enough to reach n, which describes how a point would be reached in a logarithmic graph. . Question 9 - What is the time complexity of the following code? . value = 0 for i in range(n): for j in range(i): value=value+1 . O(n) | O(n+1) | O(n(n-1)) | O(n(n+1)) | My answer: 4 (I got it wrong) . Correct answer: 3 . Reasoning: I had never seen a loop like this before and I wasn&#39;t really clear on how I could convert it to Big O notation. Now that I think about it more, range function makes n the ceiling that could never be reached. If n was 2, for example, I would end up being 0 and 1, but never 2. For that reason, O(n * (n - 1)) does make sense. . Question 10 - Algorithm A and B have a worst-case running time of O(n) and O(logn), respectively. Therefore, algorithm B always runs faster than algorithm A. . True | False My answer: 2 (Correct) | Reasoning: Part of why I gave this answer is that whenever &quot;always runs faster&quot; is asked in conjunction to a question about time complexity, I will say false. But it&#39;s also because, though I&#39;m not familiar with &quot;worst-case running time,&quot; I know that linear algorithms (according to my tests) can sometimes be faster with logarithmic ones, especially working with smaller n values. .",

            "content": "Here is my overall score on the MC. I got a 24/25, which is a 96% . . Question 21: Museum photograph spreadsheet (Skill 2.B) . I got this question wrong because I only picked 1 out of the 2 correct answers. Choice B (Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by year) was correct because filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Sorting by year will sort the remaining entries in column C from least to greatest, putting the photograph with the lowest year value in the first row of the spreadsheet. And then I put answer choice C (Sort by subject, then sort by year, then filter by photographer), when the answer was D. C is incorrect because this sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1. Choice D (Sort by year, then filter by year, then filter by photographer) is correct because sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet. . Question 25: Effect of appending three zeros to a binary number (Skill 2.B) . I got this question right but I wanted to put it here because I was a little confused when reading it. The answer is C (The transformed number is 8 times the value of the original number.) While doing the quiz I learned that it’s correct because appending a 0 to the end of a binary number multiplies the number by 2. Therefore, appending three 0s to the end of a binary number multiples the number by 2 three times, which is the same as multiplying the number by 8. . Conclusion: . Overall, I think I performed pretty decent on this quiz. I still have room for improvement however, as the ap exam requires a high percentage of correct answers in order to get the 5. I will continue to learn/develop my skills for the questions I got wrong. .",

The result of &#39;Training&#39; data is making it easier to analyze or make conclusions. In looking at the Titanic, as you clean you would probably want to make assumptions on likely chance of survival. .

Machine Learning . From Tutorials Point%20is,a%20consistence%20interface%20in%20Python). Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

            "content": "Here is my overall score on the MC. I got a 46/50, which is a 92% . . Question 18: Skill 2.B - Summer camp sessions . This question confused me because I initally thought the answer was D and the question said “only children who attend BOTH sessions eat lunch at the camp.” However, I realized what I initally put was wrong because morninglist is already stated above. . Question 22: Skill 4.C - Two robots in separate grids try to reach the goal . For this question, I was really debating my answers because I wasn’t sure if both would have actually worked. In the end, the answer was A (Grid I Only) and I put D (Neither grid I or grid II). I should have been more careful in following the pseduo code of the robot and realize that near the top, the difference between the two black squares and one black square in the grids made me get the answer wrong. Overall, I need to work a lot more on these robot questions, as they were the hardest to me on the test. . Question 28: Skill 4.B - Remove first and last two characters of string . I knew for sure at first that A was correct because to remove the first 2 characters of oldString, the code takes a substring starting at position 3. To remove the last 2 characters of oldString, the substring ends at the position that is 4 characters less than the length of oldString. However, I almost didn’t realize that C was also correct because the first statement removes the first 2 characters of oldString and assigns the result to tempString. The second statement removes the last 2 characters of tempString and assigns the result to newString. . Question 31: Skill 2.A - Algorithm to open gate in parking garage . I selected B for this but while reviewing over my answers, realized was wrong because the algorithim will turn on the motor in some cases even when the gate is already open. D is correct because it will continue past the first check and then goes onto a second check to see if the gate sensor is activated, and even a third check in order to ensure the gate is opened in only the necessary conditions. I think I simply overlooked the security necessary for allowing the gate to be opened. I selected an answer that was simply too vague and I should have read it more carefully to see that. . Question 39: Skill 2.B - Modify code to count number of robot moves . I answer I selected (C) was incorrect because inserting this between 6 and 7 would have increased the value of count once for each iteration of the outer loop, which results in count being half as large as it should be. A is correct because this increases the value of count once each time the robot moves forward and keeps an accurate count. Again, robot questions were the hardest for me and I have to continue to practice them. . Question 40: Skill 2.B - Move robot back to starting place . With this question, I got confused with the directionality of the robot. I was asking myself, is it my left, or the robots left? I then realized that I read the question wrong and that the robot faced downward when it got to the gray point and therefore, the diagram is correct. . Question 49: Skill 1.A - Crowd flow simulation . The answer I selected (A) was wrong because the model used by a simulation can be changed both before and after the simulation. I didn’t know this. In fact, one of the benefits of using a simulation is the ease of modication, so my answer makes no sense. B is correct because simulations are limited by the model that is used. There may be many reasons for using a simplified model, indlucing ease of implementation. I think this question was a matter of fact of me not knowing this information. I need to go back to the AP daily videos and review this topic more carefully. . Conclusion . Overall, this was one of the better MCS I took. I am planning on reviewing skill 2.B and watch the daily videos accordingly because those were the questions I struggled most with on this test. In addition, I need to be more careful about second guessing myself and not reading answer choices carefully because a few of my points were docked from those mistakes. .",

            "title": "My N@TM Experience",
            "content": "My N@TM Experience! . My N@TM experience was very fun. I personally found it better this tri than last tri because a lot of the CS projects I viewed increased in professionalism and skill. I saw a variety of arcade websites, car websites, and much more. The ‘vibe’ of this tri’s N@TM felt better as well because I thought there were a lot more kids and parents there from other classes this time. Being able to explain our arcade project to students and parents was fun because not only did we get praise for our hard work, but we also got some contructive criticism on how we can improve the project. For example, I realized I should change my worldle game keyboard layout to qwerty..etc instead of abcdefg. That way, users don’t have to spend a long time trying to find each key. In addition, it was interesting to see other N@TM Projects outside of CSP as well. . First Project I viewed: An arcade website created by Max, Jishnu, Alan, and Evan (Period 3 of Mr. Mortenson) . . I felt that their website was quite analagous to our website. They have a series of different arcade games in which they utilize backend databases. They focus a lot on their leaderboard and being able to display certain information from their games. I played the snake game Max made and in my opinion, it was very well executed. It was smooth, it was functional, and it even allowed users to store their data/record after the game they play. One thing I told them that they could improve on was not limiting the usernames to 3 characters because it could get repetive and not as unique as a professional game. Overall though, I think they did a very good job. They had clear functionality, clear user input and output, and met all the collegeboard criteria. Mr Mortenson also seemed impressed with their website and how everything flowed together. I also tried playing their checkerboard game, which in my opinion was really good. It felt like a real game. However, if I rememeber correctly, they didn’t have any backend work, so I suggested they added a point leaderboard system as well. . Second Project I viewed: A GPA/Academic Stats website from Alex Lu’s group (Period 5 Mr. Yeung) . . In my opinion, this was one of the best projects I saw at N@TM. Everyone had a clear frontend to backend connection and was able to explain the purpose of each of their things. My favorite feature was probably the class rank calculator where we had to input GPA, classes, etc. and it would generate a ranking for each student. It seemed like an enhanced version of Synergy, the gradebook. In addition, they had a schedule feature where students could input their schedules and compare it with other students’ schedules. They also had a cool my day feature where that included a daily schedule and checklist with an esitmated time for completion. Overall, this website was very nice and I feel like many of us students can benefit from it. . Third Project I viewed: A electric car website created by Adi’s group (Period 5 of Mr. Yeung) . . This project was very cool in my opinion. The purpose of their website was the educate people about electric car since it is the future for cars. They have a variety of user input where the user could import price, horsepower, range, etc. and match the user with an electric car of their preference and inform them about their car. I really liked the random fact generator they had as well. This made their website, in addition to their other features, much more interactive and fun as a whole. They also all had their frontend and backend connected if I remember correctly, as well as incorporated all crud concepts. Overall, I really liked this project. . Fourth Project I viewed: Another Arcade website from a group from Period 3 of Mr. Mortenson . . This was another arcade website that I found really good. They each had functional games and I especially liked this pong game because it was a two player game. This made the gaming experience a lot more genuine. Although they wereren’t fully finished with their frontend, I suggested that they changed the theme from the default to make thier game look even better. Not that the default theme is bad, but it isn’t the best either (in my opinion). I also suggested that they add some sort of backend to frontend connection in order to fufill collegeboard requriements, but further enhance their games. Overall, the game they presented was a good start to something that can be turned into something great. . Fifth Project I viewed: Cat Cafe (Period 5 Mr Yeung) . I couldn’t get a picture of this one but I definitely saw it. I thought this was one of the most unique projects at N@TM. It was extremely fun and interactive (I especially liked the worlde and rpg games). Most of them had clear backend to frontend connections and I really liked what they did with their wordle game. For my project, I’m also making worlde and it was cool to see how different people had different approaches to creating the same game. Overall, I really liked the aesthetics of this groups project and the creativity behind it. They fufilled all collegeboard requirements and I thought it was really well made. Frontend was also really well made and was consistent throughout. . Sixth Project I viewed: A car website created by a period from Period 3 Mr Mortenson Group . . This was another car website that I saw at N@TM. It helps people find their dream car and it takes people through a series of filters and quizzes. For example, transmission, car type, seating capacity, power source, mileage, etc. They used an API for this. Users are also able to sign in and create a user for themselves and add cars they’re looking at on their wish list. Users are also able to leave reviews on the website once they sign in. The frontend of this website was very professional with their home tab on the tab and the logo they had. They also had clear functioanlity, user input/output, and met most collegeboard criteria. Overall, I really liked this website. . Seventh Project I viewed: A heart artwork from AP Art Studio . . This was an interesting art piece to me. The vivid colors of red and burgundy and the details of the heart really made this piece stick out to me. I also liked the message of the art piece which was to spread and give love to each other. . Eighth Project I viewed: A turtle cup from Ceramics . . I really liked this project because it was very unique from the other ceramics I saw. The person made it so that you could not only carry it by the handle, but you could also put stuff in it. I thought that was really creative. I also liked the smooth texture of the project and the way it glistened. The mixture of green and blue was also very nice, in my opinon. I also liked how it matched our group repo name, team turtle. . Conclusion . Overall, I learned a lot at N@TM. Being able to see my peers’ projects was a great experience and it allowed me to better my own project. It was cool to see how everyone did a variety of different things and how they each finished their work to meet Collegeboard criteria. There were lots of cool frontend designs I saw, and being able to also visit classes I’ve never taken was also a cool experience. I hope to attend more events like this in the future. .",

            "content": "Here is my overall score on the MC. I got a 45/50, which is a 90 . . Question 10: Boolean Expressions equavalent to num greater than or equal to 15 (Skill 2.B)(Lesson 3.5) . I got the answer right, but I had to think about it for a bit.The expression (num &gt; 15) or (num = 15) evaluates to true if (num &gt; 15) is true, or if (num = 15) is true, or if both are true. The original expression evaluates to true if num is greater than or equal to 15. . Question 12: Controlling an elevator in a building (Skill 2.B)(Lesson 3.5) . . I got this question wrong. I originally thought the answe was (onFloor1 AND callto2) AND (onFloor2 AND callTo1). However, the answer was (onFloor1 AND callTo2) OR (onFloor2 and callTo1). This was simply an error on my part because I read the answer choices entirely wrong. I should have been more careful with what I picked because the similarity between choice A and B are nearly unnoticable. . Question 17: Select equivalent to boolean expression (Skill 1.D)(Lessons 3.6-3.9) . . Again, I misread what the question was asking. It asked for two answer choices, yet I only selected one. The answer was A and D but I only picked A and moved on. I think I need to be more careful with the answers I pick. . Question 26: Result of call to procedure Mystery (Skill 4.B)(Lesson 3.8) . . For this question I picked D, which had the robot in the center of the grid facing up. Although this is a possible location for the robot to end up in, it wasn’t facing in the correct direction. The robot should have been facing downward. Therefore, the correct answer is A, which has the robot in the center of the 5th row on the grid, facing to the left. . Question 28: Robot in bottom right corner of grid (Skill 2.b)(Lessons 3.8) . . I got this answer wrong because I selected answer B. It was wrong because with each iteration of the Repeat 4 times loop, the robot will move two squares to the left and will remain facing up. On the third iteration of this loop, the robot will attempt to move to a square that is beyond the edge of the grid. At this point, the robot will stay in the lower-left square and the program will then stop. That is not supposed to happen. Therefore, the answers are A and C, both of which correctly execute what needed to be done. For A, each iteration of the Repeat 4 times loop, allows the robot to move one square to the left and one square up and will remain facing up. After four of these iterations, the robot will finish in the gray square. For C, after one iteration of the Repeat 2 times loop, the robot will end up in the upper-right square facing to the left. After the second iteration of the Repeat 2 times loop, the robot will end up in the upper-left square facing down. Both od these result in the robot ending in the gray square. . Question 30: use drawCircle to draw figure on a coordinate grid (Skilll 3.b)(Lessons 3.8-3.12) . . For this one, I selected only one answer because I read the question wrong. It asked for 2 answers. I don’t know why I selected A which drew the circle before anything was defined in the program. I think that was a silly error on my part. I was probably getting confused with answer choice C which defined different numbers to x y and r. . Question 34: binary search on a list of 500 elements (Skill 1.d)(Lesson 3.11) . . I didn’t get this question wrong, but I had to google binary search and what it does because I forgot about it. I remember learning about it in one of the student’s presentations and it was helpful to refer back to those notes. Essentially, binary search is a search algoritihim used in a sorted array by repeadtely dividing the search results in half. This speeds up the process of searching rather than counting every single thing. . Question 41: Simulating election votes (Skill 2.b)(Lesson 3.15) . . Again, I didn’t get this question wrong, but it took me some time to answer. Essentially, the answer is A because the statement Random (1 , 5) could evaluate to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. There is a one out of five (20 %) chance that it could evaluate to 1. If this happens, the value of sum is increased by 1, which simulates a person voting for the candidate. . Question 50: ASCII character in hexidecimal (Skill 3.c)(Lesson 2.1) . . I was having trouble understanding what ASCII did and I had to search it up. I didn’t get the question wrong, but I just wanted to research more. Its basically a standard data-encoding format for electronic communication between computers. . Overall Reflection . Something I noticed with collegeboard tests are that they like to test a lot of logic and “flow” questions. Being able to carefully interpret what type of questions is going to be important in order to get a 5 on the exam. Lots of it is common sense, but they like to trick you. I think with constant practice and reviewing, doing well on the Multiple Choice section is doable. I am pretty pleased with the score I got on the test, as many of it reflects the things we’ve done in class. I will continually review the concepts I struggled with, and do my best to score a 50/50 on both this trimester’s final exam and the AP Exam. .",

This can have a impact on political and social aspects. | Computers can replace humans in jobs as technology gets more advanced, which can be bad for people financially and socially. | Benficial Effects of my project . Provides relaxation/fun for students | Presents website components (inspiration) | Quick and easy accessibility to those with technology | . Harmful Effects of my project . Addictive | Potential toxcity (games tend to have that effect) | Lessens time for school work, hobbies, etc. (kind of goes hand in hand with addiction) | . Dopamine . In my opinion, I believe the issue with dopamine is quite severe, especially in us highschoolers and young adults. We all get distracted by different things, whether its youtube, music, etc. For example, many people download social media like Instagram to get a quick sense of joy in their feed. While these 10 seconds of joy are great, it can ultimatly harm us because it shortens our attention span and distracts us. Most of the time, I leave discord on while studying, and this can be a distraction to me. While I do set my status to DND, oftentimes I feel myself clicking on message sent to me by my friends, ultimately distracting me from getting work done on time. This is the start of procrasitnation and is the reason why many high schoolers, myself included, stay up until late at night. Losing concentration is a bad thing because it makes us lose the momentum of something we may have started. Overall, from personal experience, I believe dopamine issues are real and allow people to lose sight of whats truly important. . Internet Blockers / Admin Passwords . Internet blockers help protect students from illegal/dangerous websites during school time, saving their security and time. Some websites can be distracting, which benefits the students if they weren’t present there with an internet blocker. One con is that it could potentially block websites that are necessary for students to use. For example, the AWS site back in tri 1. As far as admin passwords go, I don’t see any benefits for not having it. If hacked, it can put the school at dangerous risk, and having a admin password is an easy way to prevent this. . 5.1 Reflection . I learned a lot from the class discussion, which included the benefits and drawbacks of computing as well as dopamine issues. The class circle discussion allowed me to hear from a lot of different people about their perspectives on computing. It made me realizehow much we are dependent on technology, and how without it, most of our lives would be dysfunctional. 5.1 also allowed me to share my personal experiences and help me realize what I can do to improve my habits and become less distracted by things like my phone, discord, music, etc. . 5.2: Class Discussion . Discussion Not everyone has access to technology like phones and laptops like we do Why? Unable to afford or unable to access due to state of life | Country regulations | . | Why someone may not use technology Choose not to willingly; believes technology ruins society | Religious reasons | . | . | . 5.2: Questions . 1) How does someone empower themselves in a digital world? . In the digital age, one can empower themselves by using their ingenuity and excelling beyond others. An individual with greater creativity will have greater motivation to try and play with a variety of things, and through this exploration, they will probably discover something that interests or excites them. As a result, when someone inspires themselves to be creative, especially in the digital world, they will be able to learn things they didn’t know and will feel more confident to possibly pursue a profession in the digital world. For example, in computer science, one can take on challenges to learn new things, ultimately improving their skills and passion in the future. . 2) How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . One who is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by talking to the non-empowered person about how they overcame certain challenges and obstacles in their life and provide them with words of encouragement. This can have motivation for the less empowered, ultimately allowing them to eventually succeed if they put in the hard work. This can be seen in many clubs at Del Norte. In my club, IHL (international humanitarian law), we focus on educating society about the rules to armed conflict, and how we can create a safe environment. Essentially, working together towards a common cause can ultimatly lead to mutual success. . 3) Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . In certain scenarios, paper can slow down the changes in how the tech world is evolving. For example, a lot of people nowadays use email opposed to real mail when talking to someone. However, paper can also be useful at times. Paper is, in my opinion, more reliable and secure, but slow. At DNHS, a lot of activites are meant to be done on paper because it can be more accurate and effective. Like tests for example. Most are done on paper due to the accessibility to cheat on computer exams. That way, teachers are able to ensure safety in the classroom, which puts a lot of weight off their shoudlers. . 4) What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. . One concern that I have is that as technology continues to advance, people who are unable to afford technology will be left in the past. This wil create a larger gap in the digital divide, as more people don’t have access to technology. This can be detrimental socially as well. It can potentially create conflicts as some people may think outsiders of technology are “different” or something. Exclusion can occur, which is never a good thing. . 5.2 Reflection . This lesson has taught me a lot about why some people don’t use technology. There are a variety of reasons, main ones being that some can’t afford it, some don’t have accessibility, and some willingly don’t use it. The digital divide can potentially be concering due to the growing divide between people who choose to use technology and those who don’t, which can ultimtely lead to a uneven distribution of information. Overall, this lesson was very informing. . 5.3: Class Circle Talk . Facebook vs. TikTok TikTok is more for young adults/teenagers while Facebook is more for the older generations | Facebook is considered a place to get important information about today’s world (politics, sports, etc.) while TikTok is directed to entertain its audiences (shorts videos, memes, etc.) | The younger generation may not find Facebook entertainting and vice versa | This could be corrected by having both apps include content that could be entertaining/interesting to both age groups and not just one or the other | Tik Tok users have a shorter attention span, which is why they may be more inclined to use tik tok | . | Virtual Assistants Having Female Voices Some people may simply believe that the female voice sounds more better to the ear | Brings in more money if the voice is soothing to their audience | Some people historically connect this to women rights a century ago (women mainly provided assitance); potential controversy | For google, siri, etc., default is female voice | Female voice may be the most profitable method | . | Algorithms that Influence Our Decisions Some algorithms, such as Google, Apple, etc. will use forms of advertising in order to grab the user’s attention | Netflix can show the user with a “You Might Also Like” category, and a % match with what shows they watched in the past and what they liked | YouTube generates related videos to what you watched in the past as well | Google is able to see past things you searched up and may give you advertisements on certain items, persuading the user to buy something | . | . Are HP Computers Racist? . 1) Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? . After watching the video and observing the owner’s reaction, the owner definitely believes that this was intentional. This is seen by how he explains to the viewers what he has tried to do and how he even asks his white co-worker to try it out herself. He seems in awe that nothing happens when his face is on the screen opposed to his co worker. Although at first glance it may look like that the creators of this product intentionally did this, I personally don’t believe that this was done intentially but that it was just a testing error. . 2) How do you think this happened? . I think most of the tests were done with white or lighter skin people opposed to darker people and this ultimtely lead to not testing the darker skinned people. One way this can be fixed is testing people of many different skin tones and that way, the creators can adjust or change things before releasing it so that it works for everyone. . 3) Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? Should it be corrected? . This issue should definitely be corrected by going through a series of more tests in order to ensure this doesn’t happen again. It could potentially come off as harmful and can mislead others to have radical opinions about the company. This can lead to online conflicts and potential societal divison. . 4) What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? . I would get as much test subjects as possible and make sure to test everyone before releasing it to the public. Testing a wide range of skin tones will be important and I can make adjustments and make sure that the overall outcome is the same for everyone. That way, no problems will be detected. Once this is achieved, it can be released to the public without any problems. . Reflection: Being able to see other peoples perspectives on computing bias was intereseting and connecting the dicussion with everyday things we use like Tik Tok. It was also a very engaging lesson and helped me learn to not make testing mistakes on my own projects like the CPT. I will make sure to test all my algorithims before making sure everything is good to go. . 5.4 . 1) We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used. . There are a few APIS I have used in the past. I have tried a recipe one, and an urban dictionary one. The urban dicitionary fits perfeclty with my CPT project as the wordle game generates infinite words. However, a problem could be the difficulty of words. Therefore, I could potentially create my own API and take inspireation from Mr Morts jokes and covid APIS, and can help us connect our frontend and backend. . 2) We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub? . With Github, I am able to see how many commits people made to any repo. This can help see who is doing work and how much they did it. I also figured out that the dark green shades indicate more commits in a certain day compared to the light green commits which means that less work was done on that day. I want to be able to show my teacher constant commits and have consistent squres; this can be an example of crowd sourcing and how it influences the desiscions we make in order to fufill something. . 3) Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting? . I found it interesting that many of the data sets in the top 10 - 20 are familiar to me and probably many other people, as we use these data sets very often in our daily lives. Some of the data sets I saw included Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube, which makes sense, considering how we use these apps for entertainment and education. I was not that impressed with these results due to the overuse of them. . 4) CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . One way of crowdsourcing in our classroom environment is a survey about a particulur csp lesson idea. It can have different interactive ideas on there, and a survey is a good way to gather this data. I could potentially initiate this by having people fill out a quick survey and have specific intructions about what to write in order to get genuine, reliable results. . 5) What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . Our project could be better with crowdsourcing because we would be able to see what the general population at DNHS likes to play. We could send out a survey on social media, discord server, etc. and gather results from a very diverse crowd of students. This allows for more inclusivity and could help with a potential leaderboard based on our games. Preferences to timed games, point games, etc. can help us understand what our audience likes. . 6) What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . One way of data we can collect is user opinion on what games they want to play. We could let them play a round Wordle, Trivial, etc. and get feedback on how our game was produced. This allows for a more interactive experience between the developers and the users. Before N@tM, our group could even have the teachers do the same thing and ask them the same questions, which will make the teachers more interested in our project and more excited for us to present. . 5.4: Reflection I thought the class discussion/lesson was interesting as we got to see everday examples of crowdsourcing and how our APCSP class can utilize crowdsourcing. In addition, we got to see the multiple perspectives on the topic, and it was very interesting to hear from many different people. . 5.5 . Class Discussion: In class, we talked about how we felt about people using other peoples work. We talked about Youtube, copyright, etc. and it helped me learn more about how we feel about our privacy online. . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. Types of Licenses: . Open Source Licenses Definition: Allows anyone to use the program without needing to pay | Example: MIT License | . | Closed Source Licenses Definition: Require payment to authors based on what user makes from distribution | . | Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal Definition: Allows for the public to use the material without any copyright restrictions | . | Open Source MIT License Definition: Allows for code to be used and then made into a closed source version for distribution | Requirements: Authors still want credit (comments) | . | .

My License . 5.6 . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . Password usage in example CPT project | Classroom-specific information (class numbers, periods, etc.) | Names, emails, birthdays | . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? . Violation of Privacy Rights PII includes sensitive information such as full name, address, social security number, etc. | Sharing this information without consent can be a violation of privacy rights | . | Increased Risk of Identity Theft and Fraud PII is often used by criminals to steal identities and commit fraud | haring PII can increase the risk of identity theft and fraud | . | Legal Consequences Many laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, regulate the handling of PII | Sharing PII without proper safeguards and consent can result in legal consequences | . | Damaged Reputation Sharing PII can damage the reputation of both the individual and the organization involved | Trust and credibility can be lost, leading to negative consequences for both parties | Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. | . | Characteristics of Good Passwords Length . Longer passwords are more secure | . Complexity . A mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols makes a password stronger | . Uniqueness . Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdate, name, etc. | . Regular Updates . Regularly changing passwords adds an extra layer of security | . Characteristics of Bad Passwords . Short Length . Shorter passwords can be easily cracked | . Lack of Complexity . Using only letters or simple patterns makes passwords easy to guess | . Commonness . Using commonly used passwords such as “password123” or “123456” is not secure | . Infrequency of Updates . Not regularly changing passwords leaves the password vulnerable to being cracked | . Additional Step for Authentication . Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of identification, such as a fingerprint or code sent to a phone | Increases the difficulty for unauthorized access to an account | . | . Symmetric Encryption . Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption of data Process | The sender and receiver must both have the same key in order to encrypt and decrypt the data | . Advantages . Faster and more efficient than asymmetric encryption | Suitable for large amounts of data | . Asymmetric Encryption . Asymmetric encryption uses two different keys for encryption and decryption of data Process | The sender uses the recipient’s public key to encrypt the data, and the recipient uses their private key to decrypt the data | . Advantages . More secure than symmetric encryption | Suitable for exchanging small amounts of data, such as keys for symmetric encryption | . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. . SSH into AWS Box Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol used for secure access to remote servers | Use in AWS Deployment | SSH is used to securely log into an AWS instance and manage it from a remote location Process | A user generates an SSH key pair, with a private key kept on their local machine and a public key added to the AWS instance | The user can then use the private key to log into the AWS instance and securely access and manage it | . | . Advantages . Provides secure access to AWS instances | Enhances the security of data by avoiding the need to transmit login credentials over the network | Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. | . Hypothetical Phishing Scheme . A phishing scheme is a fraudulent attempt to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information, by posing as a trustworthy entity | . Example . A phishing email that appears to be from a well-known bank or financial institution, asking the recipient to click on a link to update their account information | The link takes the recipient to a fake website that looks like the real bank’s site, where they are prompted to enter their login credentials and other sensitive information | . Result . If the recipient enters their information, the phisher can use it to access their accounts and steal their money or sensitive data | . Other Phishing Techniques . Email Spoofing Creating fake emails that appear to be from a trusted source, such as a bank or a friend | . | Social Engineering Manipulating people into revealing confidential information, such as passwords or credit card numbers | . | SMiShing Phishing attacks via text message | . | Vishing Phishing attacks via phone calls | . | Spear Phishing | Targeted phishing attacks that use personal information, such as the recipient’s name, to make the email appear more credible | .",

            "title": "Collegeboard Grading part 3",
            "content": "This week, I need to work on being more thorough and specific with my grading in order to bring up my last week’s grad (0.9) to a 1. . Submission 1 Overall Idea: . The overall idea of this program was to create a program simulates a rock-paper-sicsors game . . Grading: . Row Score Explaintation Discrepancies . Program Function and Purpose | 0/1 | The video portion did a good job of showing the input, functionality, and output of the program, which prompted the user to pick either rock, scissors, or paper. However, only the purpose was stated in the written portion, and the function of the program was not there and therefore, will not earn the full point. | Apparently, according to CB, the response included both the purpose/function properly.. | . Data Abstraction | 1/1 | The program and response has a usage of a list, it being (RPS), and the purpose it serves is seving as random set of input for the computer. | Accorinding to CB, however, it does not show how data in the list is being used in the code. They didn&#39;t earn the point for this row. | . Managing Complexity | 0/1 | Although the response explains why a list is being used, it does not tell us why the usage of the list would serve to reduce complexity in the program. Instead the response only gives a brief overview of what can be used in place of the list, and not how that particular replacement is not as efficient. | | . Procedural Abstraction | 1/1 | The written portion indicates a function that takes in an user input and compares it with a computer move thorugh the fucntion rpsGame. This function serves to output different results based on the computer and user inputs. | CB says that the written response does not serve to explain how the procedure helped to contribute to the overall functionality of the program, and was unclear in stating how it allowed for the program to execute properly and with smoothly. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1/1 | The algorithm indicates the proper use of a recursive function call to implement iteration/logical sequencing. In addition the algorithm also uses a if statements to implement selection in the code to determine if the player won against the computer or not. | | . Testing | 1/1 | The written part of the program effectively illustrates the process of inputting two different choices, one in which the user selects rock and the computer selects paper, and another where the input is the opposite. The written response clearly explains the outcomes of each scenario and accurately identifies the results of the program. | | . Submission 2 Overall Idea: . The overall idea of this program was to create a program that challenges the user to a 5-word hangman to help them recognize new words/expand their vocab knowledge . Grading: . Row Score Explaintation Discrepancies . Program Function and Purpose | 1/1 | The video demonstration effectively illustrates the input process, features, and output of the program, enabling users to participate in the hangman game by choosing a word and inputting guesses to determine if they are correct. The main objective of the program, which is to enhance people&#39;s vocabulary and ability to learn new words, is also clearly explained in the accompanying written description. | | . Data Abstraction | 1/1 | The program and its corresponding explanation make use of a list, specifically an array, that holds the individual letters of a word (letOfGuessWord), enabling the program to conduct comparisons. The list is central to the program&#39;s functionality, as it enables the execution of the program&#39;s purpose as described in the written response. | | . Managing Complexity | 1/1 | The written response successfully states how the usage of the list serves to reduce complexity. The student responds that without the usage of a list, they would likely have to resort to the use of individual variables to store each letter, which would be difficult to implement an iterative method to check for matches. | | . Procedural Abstraction | 1/1 | The written explanation showcases the usage of the guessWords function, which compares the user&#39;s inputted word to the randomly chosen word by the program. This function takes in a string argument that represents the user&#39;s guessed letter in the hidden word and checks each index of the word list to find a matching letter. The student also effectively explains the workings of the algorithm. | | . Algorithm Implementation | 1/1 | The algorithm employs the use of a for-loop to execute iteration, which allows for checking every letter in the hidden word. The algorithm also uses sequencing and selection, it checks if there is a match between the letter and the word, and whether the number of lives is greater than 0. If the total number of lives reaches 0, the game terminates with a display screen. | | . Testing | 1/1 | The written explanation displays the input of two different inputs, one inputting the number &quot;1&quot; which is not present in the test string &quot;hello&quot;, and another inputting the letter &quot;h&quot; which is present in &quot;hello&quot;. The explanation clearly explains the reasons for each input&#39;s results and correctly identifies each outcome of the program. It also specifically references the line numbers within the code to provide a clear reference point for the program&#39;s execution. | | . Submission 3 Overall Idea . The overall idea of this submission was to create a program that takes a state inputed by the user and outputs certain information about that state. . Grading: . Row Score Explaintation Discrepancies . Program Function and Purpose | 1/1 | The video response does a good job of showing the input, functionality, and output of the program, which had the user input a state and then select different information to display on the screen. The written response also expolained the function/purpose of the program, which was to provide the user with information on a state, with the purpose to help the user learn new information. | | . Data Abstraction | 0/1 | The program and response includes the usage of a list, it&#39;s name (statelist), and the purpose it serves. However, it does not show how the data is stored within the list. As such, it does not earn the point for this row. In addition, the description in the written response for the list was also wrong as the list statelist only represents the name of the states. | &lt;/tr&gt; Managing Complexity | 1/1 | The written response successfully states how the usage of the list serves to reduce complexity. The student responds that without the list, they would likely have to code each piece of data seperately, resulting in more compelxity as a whole. | CB says that the written portion doesn&#39;t successfully explain how the operation would be more complex in detail. It did not earn the point.. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0/1 | Although the written reponse displays the function updatescreen in order to assign an index to each state, it does not have any parameters that are passed to it. This does not earn the point for this row.. | In addition to my respoonse, CB also said that the written portion also inaccurately described the main function of the procedure | . Algorithm Implementation | 0/1 | The algorithm indicates the proper use several if statements to implement sequencing/selection. However, the program does not indicate the use of any form of a loop or anything similar to show iteration in the program. | | . Testing | 1/1 | The written response shows the results/scenario of the both proceudres to identify that their program works as expected in accordance with the purpose and function | The written reponse doesn&#39;t properly show different parameters that are put in the procedures. Tt also doesn&#39;t describe the result in detail, but only gives a breif summary of what happens on the screen instead. | . &lt;/table&gt; ## Submmission 4 Overall Idea: The overall idea of this submission was to create a program that simulates a fishing game to prevent from being bored. ### Grading: Row Score Explaintation Discrepancies . Program Function and Purpose | 1/1 | The video response effectively demonstrates the input and output of the program which allows the user to move the boat using specific keyboard keys such as a and d, and then increase a total count of fish when the hook comes into contact with one. The objective and function of the program were also clearly stated, with the objective being to alleviate boredom, and the function being to simulate a fishing game. | | . Data Abstraction | 1/1 | The written response demonstrates the implementation of a list, referred to as fishtypes, and explains its purpose. The list is in the form of an array and it is used to store the total number of fish caught by the user. The response also shows how the list is used later on to output the total number of fish of different types that were caught by the user. | | . Managing Complexity | 1/1 | The written response effectively explains how the utilization of a list simplifies the program. The student does not specify what the alternative would have been without the use of a list but it&#39;s explained that it would have been more complicated and annoying as it would have required the use of individual variables to store each type of fish caught, which would be tedious, especially if more types of fish were added in the future. | CB says that they actually got it because the student DOES respond that without the list, they would have to resort to individual variables. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1/1 | The written response effectively explains the use of the clonemovement function, which is used to manage the spawning of the fish, including their location, distance, and movement. This function utilizes five different parameters to determine the range and speed of the fish. The student also highlights how this function contributes to the overall functionality of the program by randomly spawning different fish to change the difficulty of the game. | | . Algorithm Implementation | 1/1 | The algorithm effectively employs a loop to repeatedly move the cloned fish until it reaches the edge of the screen or is caught by the hook. The logic is executed in a specific order, starting with the creation of a fish clone, followed by the execution of the loop and its subsequent conditions. The use of an if statement allows for the selection of whether or not the cloned fish is touching the edge of the screen. | | . Testing | 1/1 | The written response clearly shows the inputting of two different inputs, one where the clone is touching the right edge of the screen, and another one where its not. The response clearly details the results of each procedure. | CB says that this student did not earn the point for this row because they only tested for the alternate code segments, rather than actual arguments and inputs into the function itself. It did not earn the point. | . | .",

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter).

Initially, I thought the student did provide the purpose but according to collegeboard, they didn’t state the intended purpose | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | This doesn’t earn the point because a list that is described by the person isn’t actually accounted for in the program. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | This doesn’t earn the point because they don’t decribe how the list manages complexity. They show code segments with data being stored in a list, but they don’t contain complex code. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | This doesn’t earn the point because they don’t decribe the overall functionality of the procedure. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | This doesn’t earn the point because they had little detail about their algorithm in their response They only had minimal description. | .

Overall, I think I did a better job this week grading these performance tasks than last week. There were only mild discrepancies between my scoring and the collegeboard scoring. However, of those mild discrepancies, I think most come from program purpose and function. I realized how its easy to lose the point for row 1 because students are often unsuccesful in explaining the purpose of their code. They do well on the video portion, but in the written response, fail to describe this purpose. Instead, they focus more on the code and not the purpose. In addition, I noticed that a program may not meet the criteria if it lacks detail. Some of these students lacked important details in the data abstraction section (ex: data stored in lists not being used) or managing complexity (ex: list not being used in their code to manage complexity) rows and therefore, were unsuccessful in meeting those full points. Therefore, for my performance task, I must be very detailed and specific about my program. I will also need to be able to incorporate a variety of functions, abstraction, and details about my complexity. .",

            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;import&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | from math import sin as sine pi = 3.1415296535 print(sine(pi/3)) . 0.8660149035785147 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | when given a decimal number, it will return the next highest integer 10.1 is 11 and 10.9 is also 11 | . Floor | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | returns the factorial | . gcd (x) | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | least common multiple | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . import math from math import * x = float(input(&quot;#&quot;)) y = float(input(&quot;#&quot;)) print(&quot;lcm numbers is &quot; + str(lcm(floor(x), floor(y)))) print(&quot;gcf numbers is &quot; + str(gcd(ceil(x), ceil(y)))) print(&quot;factorial of x is &quot; + str(factorial(floor(x)))) print(&quot;factorial of y is &quot; + str(factorial(floor(y)))) print(&quot;the square root of x is &quot; + str(sqrt(x))) . lcm numbers is 56 gcf numbers is 1 factorial of x is 5040 factorial of y is 40320 the square root of x is 2.6457513110645907 . Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between .

Java Script . To determine if two conditionals and booleans are the same, you can substitute the four possibilities that the two booleans (sunny and rainy) can be (listed below) into the conditional and boolean and see if both cases match: . sunny = true, rainy = true | sunny = true, rainy = false | sunny = false, rainy = true | sunny = false, rainy = false | . Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 . Convert the IP address into binary: 192.168.0.1 -&gt; 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 | Convert the subnet mask into binary: 255.255.255.0 -&gt; 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | Do a bitwise AND operation on the binary IP address and subnet mask: | 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 +11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 =11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 . Convert the result back to decimal: 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 -&gt; 192.168.0.0 | The network address is 192.168.0.0 . Binary Search . Notes on seqeuential search: . Searching when it comes to computer programs and applications involves locating and retrieving a data value/and or its index | Although for selection sort is fast for smaller inputs, it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. | Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases | . Notes on Binary Search . an efficient way to iterate through a sorted list to find a value. | This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value | If list is not sorted, binary search algorithm will not work | In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target | . Challenges and Homework . You have one homework problem. . Yes just one. . Don&#39;t get excited though. . Problem: Given a specific integer N, return the square root of N (R) if N is a perfect square, otherwise, return the square root of N rounded down to the nearest integer . Input: N (Integer) . Output: R (Integer) . Constraints: Do not use any built-in math operations such as sqrt(x) or x**(0.5), Try complete the problem in logarithmic time. . Hint 1: Maybe you can use Binary Search to try and reduce the number of checks you have to perform? . Hint 2: Is there a mathematical pattern amongst numbers and their square roots that could help you reduce the number of searches or iterations you must execute? Is there some value or rule you can set before applying binary search to narrow the range of possible values? .

We enjoyed talking to our peers about their projects too. Our favorite projects from other groups was a minesweeper and chess game because they were extremely well made and interactive for the users to play. We also enjoyed talking to our peer’s parents because they asked many questions about our project. We thought our most popular question asked was how we were able to fetch the different recipes in our website. In addition, talking with the CSA kids in the other room was also nice because we got to see how CSA operates their websites (many of them were really good). In conclusion, we had lots of fun at N@tm and we are excited to attend more in the future! Being able to talk about my code with other people was a really different, interesting experience as well. N@TM will surely help me in the future if I happen to get interships, jobs, etc in college. . Collegeboard Trimester 1 Final Questions and Review . Question 1 (Topic 1.2, Skill 4.A): Behavior of code that multiples inside a loop. For question 1, reading the code segment carefully was a important aspect in answering the question. The code initializes the result to 2 then repeatedely multiplies result by 5 inside a loop. The loop then iterates three times (Answer: D) | . | Question 2 (Topic 1.2, Skill 4.A): Behavior of mystery procedure with if statement Again, being able to differentiate all the different answers was important in determining the answer, as all of them were similar (Answer: C) | . | Question 3 (Topic 1.1, Skill 1.c): Benefits of assembling a diverse team Easy question, common sense | . | Question 4 (Topic 1.2, Skill 3.A): Data needed for DineOutHelper Another relatively easy one | . | Question 5 (Topic 1.2, Skill 3.A): Data not provided by Alejandra but needed Again, easy enough to read and understand | . | Question 6 (Topic 1.3, Skill 4.A): Documentation for procedure with a loop For this question, analyzing the code to see that it initializes the count to 1 then inside the loop, the value count is displayed and increased by 2 to the next odd integer. The loop terminates when the count reaches the max so all positive odd integers are less than or equal to max when printed | . | Question 7 (Topic 1.3, Skill 4.A): Documentation for procedue with add and div Easy enough, straightforward | . | Question 8 (Topic 1.3, Skill 4.A): Documentation for procedure with lists This one was kind of difficult to understand at first. I had to consult with other csp students before being able to determine the right answer. First, the code creates a copy of numList called newList. Then the element at newList(j) is assigned the element at numList (j). THEREFORE (this is where I was confused), the difference between numList and newList is that the elements at indices j and k are interchanged. The procedure only works if j and k are valid list indices. | I looked over my collegeboard 1.3 notes + the daily video to make sure I had a full grasp on the concept. | . | Question 9 (Topic 1.4, Skill 4.C): Error in reducing score if else Just reading carefully with this one makes the question pretty straightforwards | . | Question 10 (Topic 1.1, Skill 1.c): Faciliate collaboration between group members Easy, common sense | . | Question 11 (Topic 1.2, Skill 4.A): How nested loops with lists functions This one took me some time, but I eventually understood it. The algorithim traverses myList using two nested loops. The outside loop iterates the first elements in the list to the second to last element in the list. For the iteration of the outer loop, the inner one compares that element to every element in the array following (Answer B) | . | Question 12 (Topic 1.2, Skill 3.A) Easy, straightforward | . | Question 13 (Topic 1.3, Skill 4.C) Pretty easy if carefully read | . | Question 14 (Topic 1.4, Skill 4.C): Test cases for grade assignment with nested if Again, pretty easy. At the end, the check minus is displayed instead of the intended check plus | . | Question 15 (Topic 1.1, Skill 1.C) Easy, common sense | . | Question 16, 17, 18 (Topic 4.1, Skill 5.A) All related to the internet lesson from couple weeks ago. I had to review my notes on my website and the collegeboard daily videos to remind myself again | . | Question 19 (Topic 2.1, Skill 1.D): Adding numbers in 4-bit representation I had to watch the daily videos to understand this concept. I learned that the largest binary value that can be represented using 4 bits is 1111, which is equal to the decimal value of 15. Since the sum is larger, an overflow error would occur. | . | Question 20 (Topic 2.1, Skill 1.D): Bits needed to represent directions Important thing to know is that four bits can store 16 pieces of information | . | Question 21 (Topic 2.1, Skill 3.C): Data that can be represented with binary sequences From the videos, it claims that characters, colors, and sound can all be become sequences of bits to represent something. | . | Question 22 (Topic 2.1, Skill 2.B)L Decimal value not equal to given binary values I learned that binary 0011 is 2^1+2^0 = decimal 3. Binary 0110 is 2^2 +2^1 = decimal 6. Finally, 1111 is 2^3+2^2+2^1+2^0 = decimal 15. 9 is the only number not present in this list. | . | Question 23 (Topic 2.1, Skill 3.C): Digital representation of position of runner I was able to make the connection of Analog data, like the runners position, have values that change smoothly rather than abrupt intervals. | . | Question 24 (Topic 2.1 Skill 2.B): Put binary and decimal numbers in order Same skill as Question 22, being able to convert binary to decimal and vice versa | . | Question 25 (Topic 3.1, Skill 3.A): Appropriate data type for age Age is represented as a number, and therefore, is best representative of age. Very straightforward. | . | Question 28 (Topic 3.6, Skill 2.B): Assign cost for utility company I was kind of confused with this question but after reading the question very carefully, I was able to come to my final answer. | . | Question 31 (Topic 3.2 Skill 3.A): Character in a list of strings For this one, I had to look over 3.2 daily videos to make sure I fully grasped the concept. The element at index 3 inwordList is “ghi”. The character at index 2 of “ghi” is “h.” | . | Question 34 (Topic 3.2 Skill 3.B): Music instrument lists after assignments I had to make sure I was following along correctly in this code segment. First, the code segment initializes firstList to contain [“guitar”, “drums”, “bass”], secondList to contain [“flute”, “violin”], and thirdList to contain an empty list. The code segment then swaps the contents of firstList and secondList by assigning firstList to thirdList, then secondList to firstList, then thirdList to secondList. | . | Question 35 (Topic 3.6 Skill 2.B): Set maxPS based on time I had lots of trouble with this one at first. Getting to D was easy because it was simply an if else statement, but I was debating for a long time between A and B. In the end, I declared the answer as A because in B, the maxPS &lt;–50 would override the entire code, making it invalid. | . | Question 37 (Topic 3.3 Skill 2.B) The first statement assigns the value of num1 to the temporary variable temp. The second statement assigns the value of num2 to num1. The third statement assigns the original value of num1, which is stored in temp, to num2. The original values of num1 to num2 are interchanged. Therefore the answer is D. I think reading this one carefully was also a key factor. | . | Question 40 (Topic 3.6 Skill 4.B) Since 3 &lt; 5, the program will execute the ELSE code block and will print x - y = 3 - 5 = -2 | . | Question 45 (Topic 3.10 Skill 4.B): Values of first and second after assignments This one was kind of confusing as well. The code segment iterates through each element in the list, incrementing count1 for each positive value and incrementing count2 otherwise. The list contains two positive values, so count1 is 2 and count2 is 3. | . | Question 48 (Topic 3.1, Skill 4.B): Which variables are equal to 50 after assignments I got this one wrong. I didn’t realize that the first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of y (which is 50) to x. The fifth statement assigns the value of z (which is 75) to y. The sixth statement assigns the value of x (which is 50) to z. Therefore, x and z both have the value 50. | . | Question 50 (Topic 3.4 Skill 4.B) initials ← concat(prefix(firstName, 1), prefix(lastName, 1)) will correctly form the initials. It uses calls to prefix to obtain the first letters of each name, then uses a call to concat to concatenate the two letters in the correct order. | . | . Overall, I think that I need to most work on Unit 3 and specifcally skill 4.B . Final Score: 49/50 .",

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace. Developers use Rapid API to discover and connect to thousands of APIs. &quot;&quot;&quot; url = &quot;https://corona-virus-world-and-india-data.p.rapidapi.com/api&quot; headers = { &#39;x-rapidapi-key&#39;: &quot;26d9a3c8fbmshd1c8fc32ca8acc3p190a69jsn54f737b8e33b&quot;, &#39;x-rapidapi-host&#39;: &quot;corona-virus-world-and-india-data.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } # Request Covid Data response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers) # print(response.text) # uncomment this line to see raw data # This code looks for &quot;world data&quot; print(&quot;World Totals&quot;) world = response.json().get(&#39;world_total&#39;) # turn response to json() so we can extract &quot;world_total&quot; for key, value in world.items(): # this finds key, value pairs in country print(key, value) print() # This code looks for USA in &quot;countries_stats&quot; print(&quot;Country Totals&quot;) countries = response.json().get(&#39;countries_stat&#39;) for country in countries: # countries is a list if country[&quot;country_name&quot;] == &quot;USA&quot;: # this filters for USA for key, value in country.items(): # this finds key, value pairs in country print(key, value) .

Digital Coin Example . This example provides digital coin feedback (ie Bitcoin). It include popularity, price, symbols, etc. . A valid X-RapidAPI-Key is required. Look in code for link to RapidAPI page | Read all comments in code for further guidance | . # RapidAPI page https://rapidapi.com/Coinranking/api/coinranking1/ # Begin Rapid API Code import requests url = &quot;https://coinranking1.p.rapidapi.com/coins&quot; querystring = {&quot;referenceCurrencyUuid&quot;:&quot;yhjMzLPhuIDl&quot;,&quot;timePeriod&quot;:&quot;24h&quot;,&quot;tiers[0]&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;orderBy&quot;:&quot;marketCap&quot;,&quot;orderDirection&quot;:&quot;desc&quot;,&quot;limit&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;0&quot;} headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;jcmbea0fa2ff5msh7f14bf69be38ca6p175482jsn6c4988114560&quot;, # place your key here &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;coinranking1.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers, params=querystring) print(response.text) # End Rapid API Code json = response.json() # convert response to python json object # Observe data from an API.

Formatting Digital Coin example . JSON text transferred from the API in the previous cell was converted to a Python Dictionary called json. The &quot;coins&quot; in the dictionary contain a list of the most relevant data. Look at the code and comments to see how the original text is turned into something understandable. Additionally, there are error check to make sure we are starting the code with the expectation that the API was run correctly. . &quot;&quot;&quot; This cell is dependent on valid run of API above. - try and except code is making sure &quot;json&quot; was properly run above - inside second try is code that is used to process Coin API data Note. Run this cell repeatedly to format data without re-activating API &quot;&quot;&quot; try: print(&quot;JSON data is Python type: &quot; + str(type(json))) try: # Extracting Coins JSON status, if the API worked status = json.get(&#39;status&#39;) print(&quot;API status: &quot; + status) print() # Extracting Coins JSON data, data about the coins data = json.get(&#39;data&#39;) # Procedural abstraction of Print code for coins def print_coin(c): print(c[&quot;symbol&quot;], c[&quot;price&quot;]) print(&quot;Icon Url: &quot; + c[&quot;iconUrl&quot;]) print(&quot;Rank Url: &quot; + c[&quot;coinrankingUrl&quot;]) # Coins data was observed to be a list for coin in data[&#39;coins&#39;]: print_coin(coin) print() except: print(&quot;Did you insert a valid key in X-RapidAPI-Key of API cell above?&quot;) print(json) except: print(&quot;This cell is dependent on running API call in cell above!&quot;) . JSON data is Python type: &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; Did you insert a valid key in X-RapidAPI-Key of API cell above? {&#39;message&#39;: &#39;You are not subscribed to this API.&#39;} . Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. .

Drafting a Plan for the Final Project (Group Ideas) . One idea for the project would be a platform that consists of multiple apps (games)(maybe 3 to 4, something similiar to game pigeon). The games would take user input and it would also need algorithms to shoot basketballs, arrows, etc. This app would teach our team many different skills in programming. In addition, it will take our interest for 8 weeks due to the vast tasks that need to be completed. . Our Team Roles: . Frontend Developer: create the visual images of games on the screen | Backend Developer: create algortihims behind the scenes | Dev Ops: make sure website functions correctly | Scrum Master: faciliate the team and assign each member differnet goals, while also helping the frontend and backend developers | . Because apps like game pigeon already exist, this project may or may not be able to used outside of class. .

I would start by defining all my variables at the top, then creating my functions of code. . step 1: defining all variables (var) | step 2: creating functions for showing questions, showing results, etc. | step 3: create on-event code that will display the home screen, allow for user input such as clicking the start button, and creating a correct/wrong counter. | step 4: using the random number command, create infinite amount of multiplication questions | step 5: create code that will let user click to finish quiz or return to home screen and reset all stats | . Success in quiz . easy to understand | easy to navigate as a whole | simple | . Challenges in quiz . . creating two different on event functions within the same function got pretty complicated at one point and I had to be really careful | . Link: . Quiz | .",

For our trimester project, we want to try and create a application that can host different games that users can play. When the user inputs their choices into the app, the computer will output results with the corresponding game they want to play . Data Abstraction . The coding in this project will consist of mostly data and storing it through code. We want about 3-4 differnent games on the app. . Managing Complexity . The main objective of the app is to compare the user input with things like up arrow down arrow and outputs that allow the game to actually show what the user is doing. There will be multiple types of games the user can ask the app to play, and will create complexity as it compares multiple games together. . Procedural Abstraction . The procedure is having data stored with the person’s input. Then the results of the program would match their inputs with a game. We might call this part game abstraction, and we will include multiple parameters such as if they want tetris, snake, etc. . Algorithm Implementation . The algorithm will be based on their choice of game. Different games will be chosen based on the users input, and the games would be iteration. However, we would need to learn algorithims. . Testing . The testing will be done with a brief explanation and video. .",
