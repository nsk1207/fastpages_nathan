I added the 3 questions Mr. Mortenson had + 4 new questions. I will now explain some of the things I added to my quiz code. At the start, I added a numbering system because I thought it would look organized. In addition, I was able to calculate the fraction score into a percentage that is rounded to the nearest integer number. . Click here for link .",
